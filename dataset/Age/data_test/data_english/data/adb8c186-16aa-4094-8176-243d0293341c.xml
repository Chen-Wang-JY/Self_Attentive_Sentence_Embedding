	<document><![CDATA[@username Are we talking you not subscribing to his twitch, or him having to pay you to be in the Co-Optional?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Atari's Rollercoaster Tycoon games don't even -have- a demo. I'd rather have 30 free poops than no toilet at all. Just saying...		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username You somewhere else now, or stepped out? Tell me it's not because of the current/recent shitstorm?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Random question: are there any plans for an escapist html videoplayer? I can't watch the JQ on my phone because of flash.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username very American model though; spend money first hoping you can pay off debts later. Just like a giant credit card.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Seriously, DOTA. I leave the game because one guy buys a billion couriers, another guy suicides them, and you send me to low priority?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Did I see this right? Did you put someone with vitiligo in the latest vid? Nice.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Sock, sock, shoe, shoe, tie, hat, boxershorts?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[RIP my shoe. :( http://t.co/J0ZhY3oJlj		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Well look at it from his perspective. When have you had a successful multi-person podcast before? Aside from WoW, TCOP, TGS...		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Quite liking the style of this series. https://t.co/vNUSVTCq6K		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Have you heard of the 'new' Nvidia DSR anti-aliasing? Isn't it absurd to go back to oldschool subsampling versus cheap algos?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA["Netflix, can I see Enemy at the Gates?"  "No, but I can show you Top Gear, Mythbusters or District 9" #netflixrecommendations		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username It's not a LotR game per the title. Even then, the movies were about complex interpersonal things, not just 'meek' vs 'strong'.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username And that has been represented (though lacking inter-faction things) by the nemesis system.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username No, thanks. I'd rather have TB's face on camera instead of the other end.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username This is largely due to you being (afaik) honest and open and (to a degree) personal. Same goes for TB. Just keep doing that.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username What's the difference between your $40 cable and this $10 cable, aside from the plastic/fabric cover? https://t.co/V2lAvujn0u		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Hey, more spammers! http://t.co/kUt6s6T9K5		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Sure but if you're going to fix shit, you're spending money, and if you spend money, you're negating that tasty DoubleDipDoughâ„¢		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Oh no, looks like BF4 had some big launch issues. Just like BF3. But BF5 won't! We promise... http://t.co/jzVavYO2Pl		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username I hope you play games for the gameplay not for the story. People like you are destroying gaming. /s		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username To be fair, Apple users need cloud-protection the most right now. Not an ad for Apple, but a motivation to try Dropbox?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Disregard? You mean 'different opinion'. He's talked about gender issues several times in the past.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username And not everything needs a deep story to be a great game. Tetris, Doom, Pacman, etcetera.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Our point is that a preference for 1080p, story, or genre, or AAA or indie, a preference won't "destroy gaming".		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username That's elitist and ungrounded. He probably understands issues, but disagrees on the degree of which things need fixing.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username It's similar to the debate about affirmative action, which in itself is discriminatory and unrepresentative of society.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Upgraded my PC a bit. It now streams music and internet at 45 watts. Forty. Five. My PC is a lightbulb. It's fricken awesome.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Hey I just bought a 750 Ti SC and was wondering, did the RotT offer expire or did I overlook something in the box?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I know you're not a review guy, but this is right up your alley. A review -exclusively- about textures. http://t.co/cg5vOLTLVv		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username This seems an interesting feature. Will you only review the quality of textures, or also explore workflows/methods?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username "document". To find out a persons real name, address and as much info about them, put it in a file and make it publicly available.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username It's to get as much mud to sling online as well as to scare people IRL. It's a rather nasty tactic.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username in the sense of you putting together the bundles for sale, the term would be curator. You curate the collection/inventory.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username That's not what he says. He says go to cops, go to people that can do shit, but don't give harassers a podium.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username That's nonsense. When someone says they're Muslim or feminist, you don't associate them with 9/11 or Valerie Solanas.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username So why is #Gamersgate judged by its worst instead of by their best or by their average or on a individual basis?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username How would I be enabling them? Do asshats need me in order to be asshats? No. They try to hijack GG, so stop validating them.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username To harass a person that was corrupting. Not saying harassing her is okay, just saying it wasn't an attack on women in general.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username There have been fuckups by asshole, which should have been addressed. But instead, media have turned against gamers as a WHOLE.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username NONE were justified. You will not hear me say any of them 'deserve' threats or doxxing. Heavy criciticism, yes. Harassment, no.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username It's perfectly possible to tackle several issues at once. Aside that, I don't harass people, so I'm not living in a glass house.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username No offense taken. Just wanna make clear from that if I talk #gamergate, I'm still #antiharassment. Because it IS an issue.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Ran into the 140 character limit there, so I slightly changed phrasing. Yes, you're right; it happens - but it shouldn't.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username They're saying bullying is like (similar, not the same) in that it's largely a cyclical problem.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Not really. GG isn't about removing feminism from games (critique). It's about transparency of biases (relations, politics).		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username In fact,Vivian James is quite feminist; a decently rounded female character supporting a game designed by women.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username @username It's a screenshot from the linked article. http://t.co/MucioIquEK		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username It DOES matter. SOME feminists, SOME religious people are psycho, SOME gamers are psycho. SOME <insert group here> are psycho.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username The article in fact clarifies that it's a extremist faction. It doesn't indict the GG movement, but separates GG / harrassers.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username How serious are you about making games? There could be a way to work in a "few bad apples" mechanic regarding GG&harassment.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Did a quick google. Doesn't look like many people support this 'operation'. http://t.co/LmmTMkQztB http://t.co/jogFKOI4MW		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Hey did you find an artist for Ladra yet? I just saw the thread on @username.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Reported, retweeted.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Is it that hard to figure out? A link to multiple accounts harassing Anita. Several GGers reported them. You?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username I'm calling out violent extremists that supposedly are 'with me'. You 'oppose them' but don't call them out?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Sorry? Is this a competition or something? A sport? I thought we were talking about people harassing people?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Look at my feed, count how many times I've used the hashtag (hint: once). Now look at your own feed. Count.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username I align with the morals of the majority who want transparency. I don't align with the harassment cabal.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Valerie Solanas, Erin Pizzey, KillAllMen, ironic misandry. Don't worry. MOST feminists aren't like that. Just a small.. cabal.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I won't ask you to give up feminism. In return, don't tell me I should give up my own values because of a minority, okay?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Hey, I'm not sure if you want to keep this name. 'Doxx' and 'doxxing' are bad things living in dark parts of the internet.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username "Don't Engage" doesn't mean "don't tell the cops, don't report to twitter", just "don't give them direct attention".		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Feminists drove Erin Pizzey out of the country. Granted, she wasn't a man, but oh the irony of feminists harassing women...		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Guys, guys. Calm down. Think of a cyanic turquoise.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I know. But don't give up feminism just because a few feminists drove Erin Pizzey from her job. The majority aren't like that.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username I gotta say, that entire account feels fake. Looks like a very obvious double-doublecross.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username No I mean she's a faked anti-GG. https://t.co/P76IOI6zyv It's bad satire, or to rile up people against anti-GG people.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Hey I've got a weird bug. I got an email to confirm a new connection, but when I log in it tells me my email isn't recognized?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Gotta say, it's quite sexist to tell women they have no power.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Hmm... oh! Because power is not evenly spread throughout a gender, so some women have more power than men, and can be sexist?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Well I tried that duplicate account link. I now indeed have two accounts =P But I can only log in to the new one. Deleting it.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Derp. Figured it out. I hailed Mary, typed my Gmail address, logged in to primary account. Received the invitation via Hotmail		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username So I figure they used my old contact info. Thanks for helping me narrow this down, anyway.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Well this is an appropriate glitch. A video about being in in a quantum state... being in a quantum state. @username http://t.co/cUK5KCeUc4		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username This... this is a pretty decent high-level abstraction of everything. Well done, diagrammer. Though, why do some of the arrows 'float'?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username They"refuse to give oxygen to a disturbing minority" who "harass, bully, or intimidate" ... not #gamergate as a whole.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Why should I donate to people I disagree with? How would it help against harassment? I'll just report harassment to twitter, ok?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Who claims ignorance? GG people are reporting on & distantiating from the harassers. Analogy: If you support Islam after 9/11.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username  This is a job for... GAEMS JURNELIZM! http://t.co/nMZ0KGovda		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I feel this lacks a keyboard and mouse. =(		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username He used it twice in the past week, and once in this URL that he cannot change except for the 'johnbain' at the end.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Not quite. The top two are the same, but the bottomright one is 3f013c instead of 31013c.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Sorry. It looked like the f had no terminal, but after matching x-placements it seems an f indeed. http://t.co/GM8ZdVwNEq		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username But next time, maybe use unscaled shots, or at least the same scaling ratio for both snippets?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Not anymore they don't. http://t.co/Bn5BYA66a5 'Surprisingly' their about page is currently missing the partners list.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username It's plausible, not 100% checkable. Mercedes used to advertise, but gawker hid the ad-partners list recently.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I'm not entirely sure we should. Companies pressuring media is a risk, they could enforce better reviews etc. "Jeff Gerstmann"		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username True, which is why I'm on the fence. Secondary issue: this hits more than just Sam. Then again, several coworkers act similar.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Frankly, I'd rather see a change in attitude, open conversation instead of only covering the harassment, than see people fired.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Because these tweets are, in the grand scheme of thing, less important than the radio silence regarding transparency.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username You asked how Gawker relates to game journalism; it owns a game journalism site. I answered exactly what you asked.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Gawker is relevant because it owns Kotaku, and thus bears responsibility for it. Deadspin doesn't own Kotaku.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username And the sad part is, Deadspin actually did cover GG ethics, and in a more balanced way. http://t.co/oO9Dxu1X9L		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username You mean Jeff Gerstmann? No, the corrupt ones would be the people that fired him for giving 'too low' scores.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Not if it's relevant. A review may be personal, as long as it's transparent.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Dropping it now isn't good. The media only responded to the bad side; harassment. They need to talk about transparency & COI.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Sure. But we can choose who we read. We learn how a site/writer thinks and use that as a reference point.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username E.g. Totalbiscuit often says he doesn't like platformers, so when he likes one, that's notable. Same goes for other aspects.		]]></document>

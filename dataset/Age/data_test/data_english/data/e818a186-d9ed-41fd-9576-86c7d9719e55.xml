	<document><![CDATA[@username All of this should be discussed with the media, as a secondary point. Most important now are transparency, ethics and COI.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username  Retweeted, reported.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username The ethics point about bayonetta isn't quiiite true. http://t.co/JcgFMY5PVM   http://t.co/fkonfXayN9   http://t.co/oNIbo1nCex		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Did you only read the reddit OP? OP is for the 'operation'. majority of comments and both other links shoot him down.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username One guy (+ yes a few supporters) versus a lot of opponents. Polygon says "gamergate wants us to do this" It's very misleading.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username ... damn. I gotta process this for a bit.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username You have the right to complain. But this is advocating that publishers have power over scores. That's shilling. It's corrupt.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username It is not reasonable. Publishers influencing game scores by withdrawing ad money is HUGELY damaging to journalism.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Dude you have made HUGE mistake promoting 'operation bayonetta'. Changing review scores because of publisher pressure is corrupt.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Good thing she was already kicked from twitter about a week ago then, huh?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username hate speech?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username you consider "i think this game is sexist" to be hate speech?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Eh, I don't think the bayonetta review is 'hate speech'. https://t.co/HkLVfJIaDG		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Not really. It says that the sexualization is gratuitous and meaningless. It doesn't say you're horrible for liking that.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I'm a bigot because I disagree? Seriously, grab a dictionary and look up "bigot", "hate speech" "corruption" and "coercion".		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Saying "I think this uses needless amounts of sexualization" is not hate speech.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username This isn't gender/sex shaming. It's saying the reviewer doesn't like something. It doesn't judge YOU for liking tits and ass.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Good to hear your voice again, and know you're playing games again. Makes me happy that you're getting on your feet. =)		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Or, it's because PC gamers' persona. You can't develop games on an Xbox or a phone. PC games have mods. PG gamers are ENGAGED.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username How about you interview some every-day-muslims instead of ISIL? I.E. people that support gamersgate but aren't harrassholes?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[This awesome project is still around! Get smarter and feed people @username school meals https://t.co/MzXHjk4gQ1 via @username		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username http://t.co/pAQKLsjlkV "Nowhere on my site does it say we are journalists". Oh? #GamerGate http://t.co/mxfeT3LTBw		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Hey, can we have a calm & rational discussion without calling names? Why exactly do you feel the Bayonetta review is hate speech?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Tags alone don't mean much, anyway. #gamergate #feminism #isis #USpresident #shoes see? Look at the whole person, not a tag.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I'll send comforting words, but I won't finance their projects because I simply don't agree with them.That makes sense, right?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Reported for spam.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I'm sorry for you. I'm sorry that someone damaged you so much that you now want to see others hurt in the same way.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Sober is good. Relaxation is good. Being alive is good, even if it might not always feel that way.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username @username @username Don't be an asshole, okay?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username Can you show me? I don't like people harassing anyone. I assume you've already reported twitter?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username The bravest thing a muslim can do right this moment is to leave the religion. Because ISIS. Yeah, that rethoric doesn't fly.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Decrying an entire group for the actions of a minority isn't the correct way to go. Weed out the harassers, not the whole.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Is the harasser banned/removed yet?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username So link me there, so I can report. You're making it kind of hard for me to condemn harassment this way. Or rather, to act.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I'd hardly consider that a bannable offense though. But yeah I'll see if I can calm some people down.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Dude just stop it. It's not worth the effort because this guy will get offended by pretty much anything. Just ignore him.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I assume by now you doun they consider pretty much vulgarity a slur and it's no use bothering. If not, well, now you have.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username You know what, I give up. I tried to be supremely soft, but even that apparently won't do.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I hereby condemn harassment. Please do not contact me anymore.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username I hereby condemn all harassments. I feel we should report them, particularly ones about death.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username Here are some egregious ones that hurt me a lot, insulting me as a gamer. http://t.co/cQOA9jnV6s		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username Can we please report this @username account for harassment insults and triggering?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username That does not give him the right to harass all those who didn't. I haven't, yet I am now hurt.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username You are the one that started messaging them again, despite them clearly not wanting that.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username I feel like I now also have to report you for spam, unless you stop contacting us from now on.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username will not ask again. Stop contacting us. In return I will not contact you.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username REMOVE ME FROM YOUR MESSAGES AND DO NOT CONTACT OR MENTION ME AGAIN.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Also don't retweet me. I do not want any more interaction with you whatsoever. This is not a question.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username Well that's not true. http://t.co/rLpImoeapc		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username http://t.co/8T2164qTvC Comments? Poef! Weg comments.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Was it this thread? A Case Study in youtube promotion and paid promotion disclamer. http://t.co/OfgEDJOYku		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Vandaar: "Edit:
Regarding deletion: The official reason the admin gave me was that it was a fuckup and they reapproved it now."		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username @username  Gamergate makes such a big deal? She's been on NYT, MSNBC, NPR, http://t.co/iUlJ7XlxfP		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username @username @username Yet gamergate is the one inserting her into the discussion, instead of the media corps?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username You mean, directly having a financial tie with the people you report on?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username "British gamer who disagrees with feminist critiques of gaming culture, argues on her blog" - aangehaald als expert?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username "Cathy Young writes a weekly column" - een nieuwsartikel?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Enjoy: @username JennyOHenry cosmicglider 3lewd5me TechyFolks twilightpheonix		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Grass is one of the most essential foilages. It worked wonders in things like TrackMania. http://t.co/0Kak5zgiNO		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username And Charles Manson was a vegan. Go figure. Volkert van der Graaf as well. Also Hitler! Clearly these vegans are a bad group.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[Dutch newsshow paints GG as a hate group, uses conflicting footage. Take note, be calm, please give them a day to respond cuz office hours.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Then tomorrow, contact them and calmly explain why you disagree. #gamergate #equality #fairness https://t.co/WZ6lwbgdKB		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Reported, retweeted.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username The media reject discourse and keep painting all of gamergate as a hategroup. They tell us to drop the hashtag, because it 1/?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username is tainted. GG are actively fighting that minority, because they feel the #gamergate hashtag is worth cleaning.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username If the media so desperately want us to switch hashtags, let them create a clean one,  with traction, and move the discussion.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Notice how the only one of those screenshots with the hashtag attached to it, very quickly got a bunch of reports?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username The absurd thing is they're not supporting gamergate. They're just against Gawker. "The enemy of my enemy" doesn't always apply.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username No; revolt was based on anger at a dev sleeping with a journalist, a PR person, a boss and an award judge.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Read them. I agree with you on many points. However I think that a distinction between those who want ethics and those who		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username hide behind 'ethics' is definitely one that should be made. From the start there was this division, and yes, the hashtag is		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username tainted to a degree. But like Muslims/ISIL, Christians/KKK, I feel it's unwarranted to ask people to drop the GG hashtag.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username If anything, journalists should start their own 'fresh' tag with a decent amount of traction, if they want people to switch		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Don't do this. Contacting advertisers over bullying is a bit of a grey area but you decide. However this is unethical because		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username there are conflicting interests. You're promoting a publisher to financially pressure a higher score.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username That is an arguable point, but even if we would agree, the methods you use are unethical. The end doesn't justify these means.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Personally, scores as a precise number are bullshit, because reviews are very personal, and should serve as an anchoring point		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I know. I disagreed then as well. http://t.co/PXzqmFkBQm		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I disagree; a reviewer may have biases as long as they're transparent and obvious. And we may criticize them for that.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username but we may not try to force their opinions away.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username No it's an attempt at reasoning with you. I'm not preventing you from doing this, I'm saying that what you're doing is		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username promoting developers to force a re-review on one of their games, which would be coercion and would ruin journalistic isolation		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Everthing is seen through a personal lens, though. What makes a story good? What is good gameplay? Fast? Slow?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username An impartial-as-possible review would be nothing more than listing mechanics/bugs, and reiterating box quotes.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Do you think TotalBiscuit is a good revie- *cough* first-impressioner?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Because he acts more along SJP ethics than many 'game journalist' blogs. Yet his opinions are strongly personal.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Example: http://t.co/zlxeGYCYYr The intro makes it VERY clear he doesn't generally like puzzlers or platformers.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Which is a bias. But because he's frank about it, I can take those biases in to account, if I myself do or don't like them.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username It's 9:01 here and I'm still awake. Give me a few minutes.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Our core disagreement is about the inclusion of personal opinion and biases, correct?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username I have to go to work in 20.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username Shush. That's insulting and adds nothing to the discussion.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username I've reported several doxxers when I could. They are now banned. Is that a specific enough denouncement?		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username I generally don"t demounce an perob completery, rather specific actions. Example: operatio bayonetta		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username I believe we should focus on bad behavior, not people. Everybody makes mistakes. Some are stupid, some are vile.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username I denounce those that are actively inflicting harm, I try to esucate those who are dumb or ununformed.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username those two accounts I mentioned had only negatives. They're gone now.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username @username gotta work again now. Sorry for all spelling errors. On a phone and correcting takes too long =P		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username Well he's not wrong. Sexism is treating someone a particular way because of gender. It doesn't necessarily have to be hate.		]]></document>
	<document><![CDATA[@username For example holding open doors for women but not men. It's sexist, it's stupid, but I'd hardly call it hateful behavior.		]]></document>

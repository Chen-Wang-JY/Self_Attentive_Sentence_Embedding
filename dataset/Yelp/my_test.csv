0,The service fees are ridiculous. I split paying their bill into two months because it was so high and they kept calling me. I don't know if their insolvent but their customer service is atrocious
0,"We have had our Culligan unit for many years and it has broken down several times.  This time around when I called I was told it would cost $140 just to come and take a look at it.  No one else seems to service Culligan units so I agreed.  The first appt. I set was with a 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. window.  I sat here the whole day waiting.  NOTHING.  A tech. called me the following day saying he was coming out.  I could not take that day off to wait for him.  I rescheduled for a different day....this time given a 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. window.  Again, waited.  This time when I called I was told they were running late and wouldn't arrive for at least another 3 hours. This is unacceptable.  I am currently looking into purchasing a different unit so I do not have to deal with a company that does not value its customers time or keep its service appointments.  Maybe it's time to contact their corporate offices:\n\nhttp://www.culligan.com/en-us/d/company/contact-us/"
0,Nice folks but the water softening system has a CAM/Piston that fails often.  Unless they change that I would not buy this unit.
3,"The bakery is fantastic but so is their food. I worked briefly for a real shithole in downtown but the one bright spot was it allowed me to lunch at Azteca almost daily. I fell in love with their carnitas burros, which are HUGE and about 3 bucks if I recall correctly. One of the things I miss about being in California is how you can find those huge $3 burros just about everywhere, well Azteca is your place for that sort of thing.\n\nPlease go there and help support a great local restaurant and bakery."
1,"Mediocre tacos. \nI'll have to come back for the baked goods and see if they can earn more stars from me. Ended up there for lunch because some colleagues and I had a break from a training class and it was close. I was hoping to make a great find, but alas, they didn't impress. I figured a classic carne asado taco dinner would be a good barometer for gauging the place. The corn tortillas - now those were 5-star. the carne asada was so-so seasoned, not bad flavor, but somewhat bland, and quite tough. The mass of shredded lettuce on the tacos did nothing for it except make the lovely tortillas a bit soggy. Same for the blob of guacamole on the tacos. OK, but but so unpromising that I won't bother coming back for another meal. The baked goods on the other hand, I'll be back to try."
2,"So the wife and I woke one morning and were dying for a breakfast burrito. We could only handle Einsteins and Gag-in-a-bag some many more times. We decided, what the heck, let's give Azteca a try.\n\nAfter all, we had partaken in El Norteno and La Canasta (both really salty in our book) and were like, come on, we live downtown, there's got to be at least one place with a decent chorizo and egg burrito? Well, low and behold, Azteca is better than most. The tortillas are probably the best part in my book - really tasty.\n\nMy favorite is the Egg and machaca, although its like mostly machaca and little egg, not a bad thing. Don't forget to ask for cheese with it though, my preference for sure. My wife likes the egg, potato and cheese, and I have to admit its tasty as well.\n\nBefore you leave, grab some pastries - specifically the empanadas. I'm typically not a fan of mexican bakeries (they always seem bland in my book), but the empanadas have a little flair.\n\nNot my choice for lunch this place, you can do better at Asadero Toro or America's Best Tacos in my book.\n\nGive a shot, you'll have fun."
3,"Nice place for breakfast. Good machaca w eggs. Friendly, clean. Didn't try pastries but looked good."
1,"Highly disappointed today. BEWARE non BEEF and PORK eaters... Today, I ordered the 'combination 2 tacos' . Apparently, most food orders are for BEEF instead instead of CHICKEN. Needless to say, I don't eat beef or pork - their website doesn't specify BEEF or PORK - \n\nAnd the kicker is, when I called their establishment to speak with a manager, I couldn't get past the young lady on the phone to leave my comment. \nIt was stated \""that the customer needs to specify CHICKEN with their order\"". Granted, I take partially responsibility for that - how about not assuming that all customer's eat BEEF and PORK and ask them their meat preference. \nFurthermore, when speaking with the young lady there was no recommendation to try to fix my order, no apology, no nothing to try to amend this. \n\nAzteca update your website to reflect chicken/beef/pork or what have you instead of assuming that or a great majority of them eat BEEF. \n\nYou live and you learn huh! On a more positive note, my rice and beans were edible and quite delicious."
3,"The place has good food and friendly service. We were waiting in line while someone ahead of us was counting out pennies and taking a long time etc. No big thing to us we weren't in a hurry, but one of the ladies behind the counter came out and took my friend and I's order. I thought that was a nice touch.\nThe food was good, plenty of it and they have dandy pastries. I don't know the names of all of them but they are good.\nWhat I really like it the atmosphere. I don't know great mexican food from decent but I do know when I am eating something I like. This place just makes you feel like you are getting the real stuff, whether you are or not.\nI ate there three times on my last Phoenix visit and will do so again this spring.\n\nI recommend it, not that my recommendations on mexican cuisine are anything to write a book about."
3,Quaint place close to downtown. After touring the heard museum we headed over here in search of authentic mexican food. The food was indeed delicious! They also had a selection of home made cookies and rolls and things like that in the 'bakery' section. My friend was absolutely in love with their salsa which you can buy in an 8 oz. portion for I believe 3 or 4.99 or something like that. I was a little concerned when the person ordering in front of us had their order taken completely in spanish. I have zero language skills other than english but was pleasantly surprised when it came our turn and the girl took our order in 100% fluent enlish. Would go here again if I was ever in the area.
3,"Love this cute little local place! You have to know about it to go, but damn is it good! Huge portions, cheap, and good chips and salsa, I'm in!!\n\nMy dad discovered this gem a few years ago, and I love it when we go. Love the hole-in-the-wall vibe and the staff is really friendly. \n\nGreen chile burro=YUM."
4,"I'd like to start by saying that anyone who rates Azteca as three-star or lower is either a damn fool, or is not well versed in Mexican food. You know who you are. \nThis is about as it good as it gets for the Phoenix area. Everything is homemade and delicious.\n\nThe green corn tamales are absolutely stellar. This beauty comes out wrapped in waxed paper and corn husk to maintain the moisture and heat. It's like unwrapping presents at Christmas time, a pure delight! Top this bad boy with green sauce and dive in to find kernels of corn complemented by the perfect sweetness. The green chile is also superb and highly recommended. \n\nThe staples even stand on their own. Your meal begins with crispy chips fresh out the fryer! Throw a little salt and green sauce on them and enjoy. The consistency and flavor of the beans is just right and they are not offensively overwhelmed with cheese as so many other restaurants. The rice always has great flavor, but can range in moisture from slightly dry to very moist depending on the day (I'm assuming different cooks.) And lastly the flour tortillas. These goodies are concealed by foil to keep them piping hot. Every time I unwrap them I get a little giddy. The smell is just so damn good! There are few things better than flour tortillas with rice and beans. This is just about the best threesome I have ever had. \n\nThe only downside to Azteca is the limited daytime hours, and the large lunch crowds. If you love Mexican food, and have not eaten here you must make it a point to come. You will NOT be disappointed. I almost forgot it is also very inexpensive with most of the combos ranging from $5-6ish."
2,"I like the combination of pan dulce and breakfast or lunch burritos all in the same place. I can take a meal to go and some pan dulce for the next day! The food is very tasty, not the best ive tasted, but no where near 'not good'. \nOnly draw back was the salsa was a lil watered down, overall, i likes, i would recommend and would go back, I give 3.5 stars."
2,Good food!
4,Been going for to this place for years... the red chile and green chile burritos are the best... the pan is bomb a spot you should check out .....
2,A good place to have some really good burritos. Place is neat and has a good atmosphere. Price is decent enough. Not much to expect here though.
3,I literally group up right around the corner from here and every time I go back and visit Phoenix this is my #1 stop :) I don't even visit my family 1st until I have grabbed a quick red burrito.  Very authentic and they cook their own pan (sweet bread) as well.  I also love their soups well actually I love everything they cook! #realmexicanfood
2,"Azteca has some great breakfast burritos, too bad they don't open till after I have to be at my desk in the morning.  My coworkers love this place, I think it's so-so. Their carne asada is small, not very flavorful and the meat is boiled not grilled. The place is super busy and small so if you sit in at lunch it's a circus. For carne asada that's much better hit another joint."
3,"I walked in and everyone eating there was Mexican, that's a good sign.  The food and soda were good and so was the service."
4,"Gotta take this opportunity to thank Nick A.  He's been there since the shop opened and this is the second time I've dealt with him.  Both times have been a pleasure, as he is just very pleasant and not interested in the typical high-pressure sales style that I've come to expect from chain auto shops.  I hate to say it, but I'm sure I'll be back again for new tires....."
1,"I have gone to this Firestone location twice for oil changes in my Mustang.  The first time, I got no sticker indicating the month / mileage I needed to get another oil change at.  I didn't notice until I got home.  It's full synthetic so not that big a deal -- annoying but I just marked the calendar in my blackberry to remind me a few months down the road.  \n\nThe second time, the tech had oil on his boot and when he put his feet on the drivers side floormat to bring the vehicle back around after the oil change, he got oil all over it.  I was on the phone when I got back in the vehicle and, again, didn't notice.  My loss, because it's permanently stained. I had the floormats professionally shampooed afterwards but it didn't help.    Fortunately, it was just the floormat, not the actual carpet.\n\nTwo careless and annoying mistakes in two visits = two stars and no third chance."
2,"It's been 9 months since my last update for this place, so here's one, based on this morning's visit:\n\nI love the people & the service at AAA Auto Service, 1050 E Camelback, but come here every other time, every 10,000 miles, for my oil changes because they rotate the tires I bought here for free.  This was one of those times.\n\nThere's a new Service Manager here now, \""Nate\"".  My only complaint for today was that I served myself up a cup of coffee from the big thermos & it was ice cold, leftover from yesterday!  Uck!  Come on, Nate!  With that said, the service itself went as expected & they stay at 3 Stars.\n\nOil Change & rotate tires (bought here) is $32.05, minus $10 if you called into their survey after your last visit.\n\nPS:  Like good Mexican food?  Walk down Central to La Olmeca for a bite while you're waiting for your car.  They open at 8 AM & might even have a breakfast BUFFET going for you if you're here on a Saturday or Sunday!     :-))\n\nAlso, discount coupons are often available for both Firestone & La Olmeca if you hunt around a little."
0,I seriously wish I can give this place a -5 star rating! It has been extremely frustrating never in my many years of being a firestone customer. I have trusted them to do the right thing and they have completely ruined my vehicle and expect me to pay more. I went in for a 4 hour job and it has been 4 days since I dropped it off and yet I still do not have my vehicle and they made the issue worse! The manager had the audacity to tell me things happen! Are you kidding me it was okay and now something is 10 times worse!! Are you kidding me! Not going back. I refuse pay for anymore services from firestone!
2,Great place to have fresh mariscos in South Phoenix.
3,"El Super Coctel is just like the sopas de mariscos my wife and I get in Rocky Point.  $15 was enough for both of us, six tostadas worth.  So happy to have found a local place for mariscos."
1,"Went to Las Glorias after seeing it on \""Check Please Arizona\"".  The restaurant is all about fish.  It's not really \""Mexican food\"".  Let me say our shrimp cocktail was very good.  We both had the tacos (I've had better).  I noticed at another table they were just having shrimp cocktails and drinks.  Now I know why.  If I every return it will be only for the shrimp cocktails and salsa and chips.  $50+ total for dinner (one shrimp cocktail, 2 taco dinners and 3 margaritas).  The beans and rice on my plate were cold (most places the beans are so hot you have to let them cool a bit before you take a bite).  Sorry Las Glorias, I'm new to downtown Phoenix and next time I'll try another Mexican restaurant."
3,had the super coctel..very fresh!!
1,"Okay shrimp cocktail. The ceviche was better.  In fact if I return, it will be for the ceviche. I've had better elsewhere, but in a pinch, it'll do.  Curious to taste the shrimp Culichi.  The waitresses were pleasant.  I did not like the fact that there are no free refills on the soft drinks.  I will say that I did feel like I was transported to Mexico, which was kind of cool. Loud music, but that's how they do it!"
4,If your looking for something different and new try this place! I eat here once a month at least. The shrimp ceviche is bomb! Not to pricy for the food and a good spot to have some drinks too! It's not a Scottsdale spot so don't expect the world! Try it u won't be upset
0,"You know, it's pretty ignorant for the shop manager (travis, Tyler, whatever his name is) to argue with a potential customer when they call, looking for some work done.\n\nI need a transmission cooler installed and he wants to argue that I don't need one and he has no idea about the vehicle I am inquiring about. It's a well known fact that the particular Army vehicle that I won needs one, if I am going to be towing anything substantial. Also, he has no idea how the internal to the radiator cooler performs that is already present (stock) and that it is pretty inefficient,as  a cooler. But he doesn't want to listen and wants to debate it. \n\nIdiot. My money will spend just as well, at another shop. Way to go bro!"
0,"Run for the life of your car from this place! They took an hour or more to do a simple diagnoses and gave my warranty company the runaround! The manager Tyler is full of himself. They are slow and basically I ended up taking my vehicle elsewhere! The hours it took for a diagnosis I listened to him argue with potential customers, turn customers away before looking at their vehicle, and try and tell me about his sad love life! Do not go here ever!"
0,they gave me cold mac and cheese.
3,Sand F. said it right. I used to frequent this joint every week for several years back in 1999/2000. Glad to see they are there still. \n\nExcellent unique food. Try a slappy bag.
1,"I do not understand what all the fuss is about!\n\nMy son chose to get take out from here for his 12th birthday.  I won't likely ever order food from here again.\n\nHe ordered the combination plate #6- Chicken Chow Mein, Chicken Fried rice, Sweet & Sour Chicken and one egg roll for $7.85.  He liked it.  The serving size was HUGE.  You could easily feed two people.  \n\nI also ordered vegetable egg fu yung.  I was told it is vegetarian.  At first I wasn't thrilled with it but each bite grew on me more.  I liked it.  However, all the food was so greasy and unhealthy that I wouldn't choose to eat it again.\n\nWe ordered egg rolls and my husband said this was his favorite thing.\n\nWe got the garlic chicken wings.  Hugs chicken wings not what I usually get.  However, they were unbelievably greasy.\n\nWe got the vegetable lo mein.  Very black peppery and not very many vegetables.  I didn't like it.\n\nThe last thing we ordered was the vegetable fried rice.  Boring.\n\nThe total bill was $31.  Enough food to feed 7 people at least.  We had tons of leftovers and no one is really wanting to eat them."
2,"I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. Now on the details:\n\nThe good: I ordered the small/regular Chicken and Snow Peas with steamed rice. It WAS amazing! Really truly loved it. I normally go for stronger sauces (think soy and teriyaki) but this light sauce was just the right amount of wonderful. And for about $5?! That makes me smile.\n\nThe bad: Seriously bad location and their sign is pretty faded and say \""Tam's Mexican food\"" on it? I was like HUH?? Oh well, despite this I managed to find it. It is truly a hole in the wall that you walk up to, order, and then wait in the stifling heat for your food. And while I didn't get sick, I sort of doubt that all the health codes are being followed. \n\nThe really bad: I also ordered fried wontons, 12 for about $3. When I ordered them the girl at the counter went back and forth with me about crab puffs versus wontons? I said WONTONS not CRAB PUFFS because I'm allergic to crab! Okay so I get home with my food and pull out the TINY wontons. Last time I checked wontons had meat wrapped up in them. These did not and I was really annoyed. I paid $3 for 12 plain fried noodles.Yeah...not good at all. \n\nAll in all, barring the wontons, I would go back there to get food if I was in a hurry. Better choice than Panda Express or any of the other chain chinese food stores."
0,"A coworker suggested this place for delivery - I'll never order from here again!\n\nThe egg rolls are disgusting, the one peice of crab rangoon I received was burnt!\nMy cashew chicken with fried rice was so disappointing, as the fried rice was burnt with little brown eggs and smelled horrible (could've been the over usage of bean sprouts in the fried rice).  \nThe sweet & sour chicken could have been so great - but the breading was soggy and the chicken was so dry & chewy...\nNot to mention they forgot the drinks I paid for..."
3,"Went here with my father-in-law after a twilight session of golf. Sketch neighborhood after dark....but we had a back up plan in case of any trouble. Seriously. \n\nGreat chinese, though!\n\nSide note: Bring extra couple of bucks for the \""street walkers.\"""
0,Do not go here at all. The people that run this place are not nice to customers at all.
4,"Just found this little gem today and boy am I glad I did.  I've barely noticed the building during my many trips past this place.  You order your food outside through a a tiny window and there is no seating, so take out only, and they only take cash.  Let me tell you, it is worth it! \n\nI ordered the Pepper Steak lunch special.  The pepper steak has tender beef, green peppers, carrots, onions and peppercorns with a delightful sauce.  You get a large portion of the entree, a mound of fried rice, a yummy egg roll and a fried wonton.  You get all of this for just under $5.00 and it was ready in under 15 minutes.   Big win!\n\nThis place is so close to my work and has been there for long time.  I'm only sad I didn't find it sooner!   You can find their menu online if you search \""tam's chinese food phoenix\"".  Definitely a hit in our office!  I highly recommend it."
4,"Found out about this place via Yelp after growing tired of the usual China Chili & PeiWei. I was craving some good ole ghetto chinese food like the kind I'm used to growing up in Chicago and this place was just what I needed, I ordered 8 jalapeno wings, pork fried rice and an eggroll - it was greasy, the guy at the register was rude & a couple of neighborhood questionables showed up while I was there but man was it worth it, this definately hit the spot.\n\nThey have descent lunch specials and my total came to $9 and some change for all that I listed above, I'll be back.\n\nThey accept CC but there's a .75 service charge - not sure if many know it's illegal for businesses to add service charges for card use but it is...considering the neighborhood I would be a little leery carrying cash in the area at night if you're not from those parts."
3,"Great food for a decent price! Their garlic chicken wings are superb. I will definitely say it's a hole in the wall. Nevertheless, I'll  sacrifice ambiance and great service for yummy Chinese. It's hard finding decent Chinese food in Phoenix. This here is one of them!"
0,"Being a business owner myself, I have always lived by the mantra that the customer is always right. This is definitely not the case with this business. I have a video production company and my crew of 2 contractors is working today at the KROC's Boy's and Girls Club literally across the street from this place. I'm currently in New York over the holidays so I'm doing my best to provide them lunch the best I can with the resources available to me. And being that I searched for \""delivery\"" on Yelp and this place has a \""yes\"" under delivery, I would assume I could get the food delivered. That wasn't the case today. The person that answered the phone said \""No delivery driver today\"". Like, what? Is there a schedule for when I can get delivery and when I can't? So, whatever, no problem. I said, that's fine, I'll just order the food and have one of my guys come pick it up real quick. I told him the situation and I asked if I could just pay for the food over the phone since I wasn't in the area and I needed to get these guys lunch. He said \""No, we don't do that.\"" Ok, so if someone orders delivery from you guys (on the on days for delivery at that), I'm sure they take the credit card over the phone and get it dropped off no problem, as I'm sure the delivery drivers don't walk around with credit card swipers. Long story short, this guy obviously didn't want my business because he was the most un-accomidating POS as I tried endlessly to find a solution without having these guys come out of their pockets to pay for a meal that me as the business owner should be providing them. It's a shame too because we have a contract for the next year where we'll be filming at that location one weekend a month which could have equaled some good business for these people over the year, but, being less than a smart business man, this person didn't see it that way. It's crazy to me too because our business isn't even a consumer based company and I can sit on my couch at my house and take credit card from my clients over my phone like nothing, and these guys act like it's no big deal to turn away clients. If you need some delivery, don't even bother reaching out to Tam's. If you're local and are going to eat at this shop, do me a favor and slap this guy squarely across the top of his head for me. Happy days!"
1,"So I called a random Pizza Hut, found out they won't deliver to my house.  They give me the number of the closest Pizza Hut.  I call them.  They don't deliver to my house either, but I can come pick it up.  So, I order my pizzas for all the folks there watching the game that night (Night is actually an important detail here) and about 10 minutes later I drive on over.  I can't help wondering why this location just 8 minutes away from my house doesn't deliver.  \n\nNow I know.\n\nThe Pizza Hut doesn't have a door. It has a window.  Yes, a window.  More in the \""Protective\"" than the \""Decorative\"" sense of a window.  There are 3 groups already there ahead of me.  Two look quite respectable, one... well-l-l........quite a bit less so.  One group picks up their pizza.  Down to 3 of us.  The other group is a small family and they are ordering right at the window and are going to wait for it to be ready.  Scary guy, who's been kinda twitching and not making eye contact, says I can go ahead of him.  Thank goodness!  I grab my pizzas and I'm out of there.  \n\nWhile the pizza was fine there (not impressive but didn't make me sick), I am never, ever, ever picking up pizza here alone at night.  \n\nEver."
0,"I ordered the overstuffed Italian pizza for $12.99 by phone per the operators (sounds like a African American woman) suggestion that i order this special.  So i say\"" Okay, sounds like a tasty pizza, i will have one\"".  I completed my order and the operator said\"" Okay, that will be out to you in one hour\"".     \n\n At this point i am very hungry because i'm working a 16 hour shift and i'm not allowed to leave my post while on duty so i have to get my pizza delivered.\n\n1 hour 20 minutes later i call them back and ask \""Where is my order? The operator (sounds Hispanic or White) answers\"" I'm sorry sir, we cancelled the order due to the fact we no longer carry that type of pizza.\"" \""We also tried to call the number you gave us to inform you of this.\""  I informed her that there were no missed calls on my desk phone and i was by that phone 90% of the time in the last 2 hours.\n\nThe operator offered me a discount if i reordered another pizza and i asked\"" How long will it take to get it out to me?\""   The operator said\"" 1 hour\"".   I said\"" No thank you\""   It was already late into my shift and i could just stay hungry till i got home.  If she would have said\"" 30 minutes\"" then i would have reordered another pizza.\n\nI will not order from this location again. They have workers there that ring up pizza specials that they no longer offer. lol Advice to the Manager of this restaurant: Remove menu items that you no longer offer FROM THE CASH REGISTER COMPUTER.  Then you can avoid these types of problems."
0,People in the hood need to learn how to follow directions. I made an online order and the driver read me what I ordered and looked at what I didn't order.
2,Yeah its a window. Hardly any parking to speak of. Would give it a higher review if it was a an actual sit down resteraunt. My pizza wings and bread sticks were fine. But have to say I get better quality from domino's pizza.
0,I would give negative stars if I could. I ordered a couple pizzas and some wings and the order took 2 1/2 hours to arrive. Two and a HALF HOURS!!! When it finally arrived it was cold. Not even luke warm. We called to complain and they gave us a credit but in order to use the credit we had to call in the order instead of order online. \n\nSo we just called to use our credit. The pizza guy came and asked for the full amount...no credit was applied. He didn't even offer to call in and clear up the confusion. We sent him back with some choice words and didn't get our pizza's.  \n\nEPIC FAIL PIZZA HUT! TWICE!\n\nThese guys are seriously operating with brainless idiots. Pretty sure they are completely stoned over there. It's a complete joke. NEVER EVER order from this place EVER!
0,"I want to give negative stars but I can't. Live in a nice quiet part of town. Just moved to some apts about 3 weeks ago. Have been ordering pizza hut at LEAST twice a week AFTER 7 PM, over tipping because I know how it is as a driver. I place an online order on 12/19 around 10:25, get a call 30 MINUTES LATER from the so called \""manager\"" saying \""we don't deliver to apt complexes after dark\"". mind you \""dark\"" is at 5:30pm this time of year. My intelligence has never been so insulted. I will never order from here again and I will def tell anyone who I can to not patronize with this company. I will be taking my boycott to all other forms of social media, small issue or not."
4,"After searching 4 other nurseries for help identifying plants in my landscaping, with no luck, the staff at Whitfill's took one look at the photos on my camera and nailed three here-to-fore mystery plants.  And they had them in stock.  Very helpful and professional.   I have found my first stop for future landscaping needs."
2,"Nice selection of plants, staff a little standoffish. I had a bunch of questions and picked up a few flowers."
4,"We aren't exactly professional gardeners, but chapo walked us through the nursery helping us make the right selection. He even drove us to another part of the nursery to show us a particular plant he thought we would like. This place has crazy low prices. We got 16 plants for $195 (including 4 huge shrubs, an ocotillo and a large blue agave). A few hanging plants were $3 each. We would have spent at least twice that at Home Depot."
2,"Located in the deep hood on the southside, near the corner of 7th street & Roser in between a liquor store and a recreation center infront of the high school that still holds the record of most student sponsored riots and most confiscated guns in the Nation. Nestled in the crossroads of three of the largest gang's territory in the state, Wong's To Go has been a firm establishment in what can be a very chaotic environment. I personally love the southside... it's tension, it's colorful characters and colorless buildings are beautiful to me.\n\nOpen primarily for lunch, Wong's has been open for along as anyone can remember. A serious hole in the wall needs to be approached with serious caution - not because of it's surroundings... but because of the curt and often moody cashier. \n\n\""WAI!\"" screeched the elderly Chinese woman as she slid the take out window open. \n\n\""Nee Hoy Sha Yin-Wah-ma?\"" I asked to the amazment of my good friend Jackie who has never heard me say a word of Chinese in her life. \n\n\""English?! YES! You speak Chinese?!\"" She said as her face brightened up. \n\n\""Wahhh hoy shwah id-yar.\"" Indicating that I only spoke a lil bit of Chinese. \n\nWe quickly ordered from their very limited menu with limitless flavor. One order of 4 pieces of chicken wings (the entire wing btw) and a quart of beef fried rice. \n\nStanding around in tiny parking lot talking about whatever, I noticed how there was a small fridge displaying different energy drinks and sodas. and my friend explained how there used to be picnic tables and even shade for ppl to wait under while their food was being prepared. After the riots between rival gangs, during which one gang used the tables as a randez vous point - the city had asked the Wong's to take out the tables. She described to me how there used to be an open window like in fast food places and how after getting robbed on evening - the wong's changed their hours to closing during the early evening and now have large bars over their windows. \n\nI really felt for the Wong's to put so much into their business only to have the tremultous neighborhood love them so much and at the same time be the cause of much of their woes. Just as I was beginning to wonder off into oblivion - our order was up and it was gooooood!!\n\nThe chicken was crispy and simply fried. No batter, no dredge - nothing... it was delish! As was the beef fried rice that boasted sprouts and a lil char that Jackie requested. Burnt bits are good!  yum! Our entire order was $10! We drove away as a gagle of teenagers hungry after their last class walked up to place their orders. \n\nTo my fellow yelpers: The southside is a place that is special to my heart. Perseverant, rough and colorful... there are places where it can be scary to venture into... but stay on the main roads and be a polite driver and you should be alright. Go and pay the Wong's a visit but don't be surprised if Mrs. Wong isn't exactly a happy camper. lol. Try the chicken wings, they're GREAT!"
3,"Much has been said about the other Ranch Market location (http://www.yelp.com/biz/IiwgHkUbBt9Ha25H4dUtkw) but I have to give some major props to my neighborhood location.  It is as amazing as the other location, but more important for me, when I first moved into my house it was the closest grocery store.  I had no idea what to expect when I walked into the place.  WOW! It was like a happy assault on my senses.  You walk right into their bakery section and the view of the cakes and deserts combining with the smell of sweet breads and cinnamon was kinda like love at first sniff.  Their veggie section is second only to AJ's in my mind - but for less than 1/2 the price.  And while my girlfriend has always been picky about where she would buy fruit and meat - this is her favorite place to get meat and seafood in town.  \n\nMinus one star for the parking - which is never pleasant, the fact that I'm occasionally surprised by what they don't have, and since this location isn't quite as popular w/ the gringo's yet in some departments you can't find someone who can speak even limited English as my high school Spanish does NOT help me here.  The English part is slowly changing and now I can always be sure to at least check out with someone who is bi-lingual.  \n\nAs my neighbor said when I took them here \""Wow!  How can you ever be sad when you leave here? It's like a party!\"". Therapy by shopping?  Not a bad plan..."
3,"I describe Ranch Market as the Disneyland of Supermarkets. \n\nSeriously, this is not the place to shop too late at night or you'll never get to sleep from all the excitement you just experienced!  The music is loud, the lights bright and festive, and the smell of the food makes your mouth salivate.\n\nI mainly shop here for three things:\n1) I always buy my nieces birthday cakes there.  The price is fantastic for a customized cake for kids.  The selection is incredible!\n2) If you are familiar with the Mexican baked goods - this place is a one stop shop!  For for a nice change from traditional french bread, try a \""bolillo\"" (a Mexican roll).\n3)  Rotisserie Chicken.  \n\nBut ....just so you know...the produce is great and less costly than Frys.\n\nTwo warnings .  First it's difficult to get in and out of the Ranch Market on S. Central on the weekends -- it's VERY VERY CROWDED!  Second, this is an \""ethnic\"" experience.   My husband, a \""gringo,\"" has, on occasion, encountered some language barrier challenges, but has always been successful in navigating it. - so don't let it stop you!\n\nThe Ranch Market is always on the tour for out-of-town-guests who visit us from the East Coast.  No way would you find an Super Market like this back there -- unless maybe you were in NYC or Miami."
4,"Step into Mexico when you enter this market- No one speaks English, prices are low, and the food is delicious\n\n* Great selection of Mexican produce, dry goods, and meats (almost any part you can think of)\n\n* For Americans- They have fresh taco shells, tortillas, chips, and all sorts of dips.\n\n* There are a few areas of the store you can eat. Taco Bar, another food bar (including soups), Juice Bar, and Ice cream. \n\n* Overall: Excellent cultural experience for you and your taste buds. Warning- Come hungry!"
3,"This is definitely one of my favorite groceries, and I always have a fun time here.  One previous reviewer likened it to Disneyland, which is spot on -- it's like a big extravaganza of fresh foods and pantry items.  And yes, I too prefer the produce at Ranch Market to many other stores, although we're now getting more of our through Bountiful Baskets.  So now my best excuses to trek over to Ranch Market are to buy hard-to-find ingredients, fresh cheeses, and maybe enjoy a fabulous taco while picking up those other items."
3,"Fresh tortilla, just made. Huge selection of fresh produce. The butcher has everything you can imagine. Fresh fish looked beautiful. Had a $3.50 lunch that was great? Salsa  and guacamole bar , all fresh fresh fresh. Great place to shop for a party."
2,Love this place for produce. Clean and well stocked. Short wait times in line. Probably wouldn't pick up anything else here. But that's OK.
3,"Phoenix Ranch Market is a chain supermarket that is a natural food store that sells organic products and offers a lot to the vegetarians and vegans in the area. This location is great, it has nice employees and ample parking. The salad bar and bakery are to die for. Phoenix Ranch Market also has a rather extensive selection of natural health and beauty products."
4,"I'm a huge quesadilla fan. I'm also a big fan of fresh food. In addition to that, as often as possible I like to be a patron of the small locally held businesses in the area where I live. I like spending my money there because they spend their money here and we all know that's good for the local economy. Okay so here we go.\n\nThis place has a pretty big blue sign on the front of the store. They have a half a dozen or so parking spaces of their own in front. It's nothing to look at but what goes on under the hood is pretty darn special. There is only about 5' x 12' of walking space in front of the counter. Directly in front of you when you walk in the door there are pork rinds, Cabeza, Cow Tongue and a few other traditional Mexican entr\u00e9es nicely seasoned and cooked. In the back behind the counter you can see through an open door, a team of folks working hard and making tortillas. This is what I was here for. Now over to your right they have prepackaged in a few different denominations and sizes fresh tortillas made probably only earlier that day and packaged right there on the spot. I bought myself a dozen 12 inch flour tortillas for $1.98 . . . . I couldn't wait to rip open the package and try one right outside the store (I ended up eating three)  Yummy ! All I can say now is I don't know if I can go back to the ones I used to get at Fry's. If any of you have ever had fresh flower tortillas you already know what I'm talking about. Check it out for yourself!!"
0,"Please people disregard the first four reviews. I wish I had,, what this place is, ishands down the crappiest tortillas I ever had. I think at one time they made very decent ones from the reviews. I dont think these people are not aware of what they eat. I purchased some today and they aren't good enough for hungry dogs. If u warm them up WOW they turn into a hard crumb making mess. Chicharones are okay a little salty but good. As far as sweet breads I did not buy, but they looked tasty. Drive as far as you have to to find Carolina's Restaurant there are a few in town now."
0,"My wife booked Lyons Roofing to come first thing on a Friday morning so it wouldn't be too hot.  We were thinking about the worker and willing to get up early on a day off.  We received a confirmation e-mail earlier in the week.  \n\nOn Friday morning, I received a call from the worker stating he got tied up at his first job of the day and wouldn't be able to make it until later.  I said, \""No problem, I understand.  We'll be around all day so just let me know when you can make it.\""  Even though I had other things to do, I stayed at home waiting for the call back, which never came.  \n\nThat was one month ago today and we have never heard back from the company.  Still looking for a roofing company, but definitely would not recommend this one.  Warning: They were recommended on Angie's List, too!"
4,"Perfect from start to finish.  I wanted to wait a few months and make sure everything was done as expected.  We did a layover my current asphalt shingle roof.  Jared came out, walked me through the whole process and why Lyons would be happy to do this job.  I made it very clear that I was going to have multiple quotes done and he gave me some great tips and questions to ask.  After that whole process they were a bit higher than most (about $1000).  After a conversation with Jared he was able to make the number fit a bit better.  My concern was quality over price and I made that very clear to all roofers who came out for an inspection/estimate.  They came out on time to start the job.  The crew was very informative and courteous.  The job took about 2 days longer than anticipated....BUT, I wasn't going to be home, and it was my roof.  It could have taken them a month and it wouldn't have hurt my feelings.  When I got home from my trip I had a new roof, new ridge top vent, new chimney cover, painted roof fixtures, and a new ac unit put back exactly as it should have been.  Yard was spotless as well.  I would recommend these guys to anyone.  Another very deciding factor, was they would handle any and all insurance clams due to hail, rain, or wind.  That's really important as those things are common here in Arizona.  Piece of mind, from a great LOCAL company, that follows that up with great work!"
4,"If you want a roofing company that knows what they're doing (&, obviously, all of us do, right?), takes the time to make sure YOU know what they're doing & why they're doing it, & most importantly, won't try to swindle those of us who know nothing about roof durability & proper repair techniques, then Lyons Roofing is the company you want in your corner.  A very informative project specialist (Lou Ann) came by two days after my initial request for an appointment to assess damage to some clay tiles on the exterior portion of our complicated roof (pitches here, valleys there & flat, rolled roof areas on yet another portion) & to scope out a rather suspicious bulge in our interior kitchen ceiling.  She (yes, I said \""she\"") came to the appointment prepared with a Google Earth color printout of our roof with the problem areas highlighted based on the cursory info I had given the wonderful person (Katherine) with whom I spoke with initially to schedule the appointment.  After getting the lay of the land by viewing the ceiling areas corresponding to the exterior distressed areas, she got on the roof, took lots of pictures & closely explored the questionable areas.  Once she'd thoroughly assessed the entire situation, she showed me the pics & explained what my builder had originally done, what she would recommend & how these adjustments would fare over time taking into consideration the penetrating Arizona heat & how long-term sun exposure could affect the repairs, etc.  Each person I came in contact with from Lyons was extremely professional & very accommodating.  When planning for the repairs, they were very mindful of my budget & considered every aspect of the job to make sure it fell in line with exactly what we originally discussed with no surprises in the end.  This is the company you want making repairs to your roof - they have the knowledge & expertise to get the job done right & don't attempt to take advantage of the lesser experienced homeowner."
1,"To start, I really liked our estimator and everyone seemed very professional and great to work with.  I have no doubt their work would be good, the pricing though felt fishy.  I just post this as a word of caution.\n\nWe have had an aweful time with our previous roofer, the roof we had Lyons look at was only three years old.  The estimator was able to come to our house early, and beat me there.  He called me from the roof and asked why he was there, it was a new roof.  \n\nHe was adamant we were to contact the contractor's board (we're past the two year statute of limitations and had exhausted the previous roofer with requests to fix the damaged boards around the chimney and the AC unit).  When I explained he said well, if you want to spend your money we can help with that, he said jokingly.\n\nHe said the roof was in good shape, then after reviewing the inspection report he went back up on the roof and came back with a quote for an entirely new roof, twice the price of the original bad roof and literally $12,000 over the other two bids we recieved. \n\nMaybe he felt that we were wasting our time because he brought up the contractor's board several times, maybe he hoped it would turn into a lawsuit.  We've exhausted all optioins and just wanted it fixed with no lawyers. \n\nNot sure what happened here but if you decide to use them, be sure and get more than one quote!"
1,"My rule here is not to buy anything that isn't pre-packaged.  Bag of Doritos - fine.  Loose fruit and veggies - um, no.  Can of product with a brand name I recognize - sure.  Meat - heck no.  \n\nHere's the thing - it's the closest grocery store to me in many ways (If you don't count the Super Wal-Mart, and I don't) and I really wanted to like it, but it just kinda freaked me out too much the first time to trust it again. After going into Ranch Market I figured this would be about the same.  I was SO wrong.  The produce section had flies all over it and many of the items were well past their naturally intended expiration date.  And once you got half way over - the smell of the Carniceria was SO strong and rancid I almost tossed my cookies right there.  This was about... oh... 8-9 months ago.\n\nLast week I ran in because \""someone\"" at home wanted a bag of Doritos and some sour cream.  It was a block from where I was, and both of those products would be pre-packaged so I figured I'd give it a shot.   I could tell that they had made some improvements, and their produce and meat sections looked much better, but I'm not willing to throw those dice just yet.  \n\nPersonally - I say just go down the street to Ranch Market.  It's right on Southern and such an amazingly different shopping experience.  Besides, you really don't want to be there if those improvements start to back-slide again.  Blech!"
1,"The south side of Phoenix, for no clearly apparent reason, is a completely other world compared to the north side. Until you hit Baseline there is a measly handful of grocery stores in this area, and this is one of them. I'm thankful for its presence, but truthfully it's a ho-hum store. Produce is inexpensive, but it's often aged or bruised in some way. I've encountered fruit flies more than once here. Their target customers seem to be harried Mexican mothers on a tight budget. The prices are not great compared to the service of the store. Fortunately there is a small eatery there and it's possible to get a few freshly baked items."
3,Best carne asada burritos this side of town. The ladies are nice. The place is not the fanciest but it's always clean. The prices are fair.
0,I got food poisoning after eating a chicken burrito from this place about five years ago. I have never been back since. It also made me not want to eat a burrito from any other place. I slowly have eased my way back to enjoying burritos this year.
3,"I  would have to say this shop has guys that give a good haircut. My review would have been 5 stars but they lose a star for speed.  I  don't know if this is just how barbers cut in PHX but they are extremely slow while cutting your hair. Maybe I  am just used to getting a cut back east.  Everytime I go the staff is welcoming and friendly,  I  would recommend to my friends."
4,"This place is amazing, they have so many hard to find items.  I love the fastener section"
2,"This location is inside a gas station/mini mart.  The parking lot is often full so be careful when manuvering through it to get to the drive thru.  Or you might just go inside and sit.  There are pleanty of tables to accomadate the lunch rush.  The thing about Del Taco is that if you order a combo, maybe a taco and a burrito, you get fries with it!  Kinda weird but who doesn't like fries right?  It's filling and cheap.  The other two reviews here are from 3 years ago.  I've been here a few times and customer service is fine, even at the drive thru.  You can't beat 39 cent tacos when you're on a budget!!"
2,"Ok, it's not really fair to try to review this place after having just gone to Juan's Authentic Mexican Food on Saturday.  You see, at Juan's you get 5 Star everything for an amount that you can easily spend here!  With that said, this Del Taco has comfortable booth seating & the food is passable.  I will say, though, that the Macho Combo Burrito isn't as good as the ones I used to get in L.A. because over there they put sour cream on the burrito along with the other things, & mine today didn't have any.\n\nAlong with this burrito, I had a small hard taco & a small soft taco.  (These 39 cent tacos aren't on the menu here, but they have them if you ask.)  My total was $4.57 + tax, but my son spent almost $8 + tax for his order of 2 items & a coke here.  If he had gotten, say, a shake instead of a coke, his total would have been over $10!     :-O\n\nI think this place eekes out 3 Stars, barely."
2,"okay so Rand H. and I when here for a quick bite to eat I ordered a macho combo burrito and I added steak to it for an extra dollar. I also ordered french fries and a small drink it was a combo with the dollar hop up. Anyway my meal came to around eight bucks and change, an Rand\ntold me I could get for the same money at Juan's Authentic Mexican Food\nor at Filiberto's a heck of a meal for the same money. But what the hey there we were. I hate it was full but it was nothing spectacular. And the help was an awful and the place wasn't anything special. So three stars to eaks out of my forgiving mouse hand. That's all I have to say about that."
0,"I have been here three times and I'll never go here again. I went to the drive-thru and sat and waited and waited about five minutes. Finally, I pulled up the window and finally somebody poked their head out and asked what I was doing there. I explained that nobody had taken my order at the speaker. He looked at me like I just killed somebody. He took my order and I got it quickly. I came back another time through drive-thru and whoever it was had difficulty understanding so I pulled up to the window without being able to complete the order. At the window, the person who appeared to be a manager took my order and said with a sulky attitude that \""it helps if you speak up.\"" Clearly a speaker problem, not me. The third time I had to go inside and make change for the bus. This they could handle without a problem. It seems that that's all they're capable of doing."
3,39 cent tacos and good breakfast.
0,"I love you Del Taco BUT!!!!\nIf I pay near THREE DOLLARS for a burrito I expect it to be bigger and better than Taco Hell's $1.69 disaster.\nAlso, THE WAIT even inside is grinding on my very SOUL.\nThere's always just TWO PEOPLE working.\nSorries don't cut it if EVERY TIME I HAVE TO WAIT AGES even if there's only a few people ahead of me! Take a lesson from 3rd Street location.\n---------------\nApril 2013: GOD DAMN YOU. I was the only person in the place, there were 2 drive through orders, and I STILL HAD TO WAIT FOR AGES!! \n\nAND my tacos were crammed with lettuce.\n\nSTOP IT!!!!!  \n\nYou just got degraded to ONE star.\n\nWHAT\nTHE\nF*&%\n\nApril 23/2013: See what happens when you have a manager as an extra person to help out? YOU BUST YOUR ASS THAT'S WHAT!!! I had my order in a few minutes.\nThanks and keep it up or I'll start complaining to Mister Manager.\n\nApril 25: I nearly keeled over in shock. SIX PEOPLE WORKING.\nI had my order in under 2 minutes.\nTacos are now 49 cents.\nWe shall see how this new plan plays out and maybe you get a star upgrade."
1,"It was 11pm and we had just gotten back from the PHX airport.  We were on a mission for some late night tacos.  I've never been to a Del Taco before but hey, they're open late, so why not?\n\nPros: \n- cheap\n- open late\n- drive through was fast and cashier was friendly\n- we got a bunch of coupons and hot sauce\n\nCons: \n- way too much salt in that beef\n- just not that good (I actually think Taco Bell's hard tacos are better... can't believe I said that)\n- random person hanging outside of the front door prompted us to use the drive through"
1,"This Del Taco isn't in the best place of town. It's also connected to a Circle K. As I pulled up there were various people on the sidewalk, just sitting (keep in mind it's 100 degrees)... a little odd, but to each his own.  Drive in window is locked down, so they had to unlock it to give me my food, and then promptly relocked it as I was pulling away. Interesting... Overall the food was eatable. Especailly considering it was Taco Tuesday so $1.09 for three! Score. If there was another del taco within the area, I would happily never come back to this location again."
1,"I like Del Taco it reminds me of Might Taco in Buffalo NY. But this is the hands down the worst location Del Taco owns. They have forgotten my sour cream on my tacos 3 orders now - only went 3 times so far, so not that good. To be honest they put it on just one of 6 once , which is prob the more frustrating. The dang sour cream cost as much as the tacos but I like it. Tacos have all the meat in a lump, cheese one end and they are too lazy to fold the paper around them properly so you have lettuce all over  before you even eat. The location is not dirty but looks like a high school just passed though every time i visit. Go next door to taco bell or Whataburger."
2,"Their food isn't bad, it's pretty hard to mess up gyros, rice, salad, and fries.  When it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference.  For me, I didn't care for this place.  I like crispy fries, their fries are soggy.  I like Beef & Lamb gyros, theirs are Beef only.  I like a mixed green salad with light onion, they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion.  Their prices are fair, portions large, and service friendly, it's just not for me.  They did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good, if that's your thing."
1,"This is definitely a Meh rating.  If I did not work near, then I would never imagine going, as it does look a little sketchy from the outside. \n\nThe food itself is just ok at best to me.  Don't expect any salads to knock your socks off as this is not their speciality.  They have decent thick cut fries, but not the best.  They can sometimes be overly soggy.  Most of the folks that like a greasy gyro would dig this place, but I think it lacks full flavor and other options outside of gyros - which I do realize is hard to do when you have the word Gyros in your name.\n\nIf you have more time, there are other places within 5 minutes that for the same cost are worth going to and passing over this place."
1,"On a recent trip to the Valley of the Sun (or Hell is what it should be called during this time of year), I thought I would get my Greek food fix by visiting Jay's.  Bragging about their *authentic* Greek gyros, I thought, surely they would compare to our great Greek restaurants in the pacific northwest serving delicious food that will make me want to cry.  Sadly, I wanted to cry but not in the way I had hoped.\n\nTheir servings are huge and you do get plenty for what you pay for.  Their gyros are gigantic and they don't skimp on the lamb or chicken.  But the flavor was a bit off.  It just wasn't up to par with other gyros I've had and it didn't come with lettuce!  I ordered their Greek salad w/chicken kabob and although the chicken was charbroiled just right, the flavor was again a bit off.  Also, I wasn't a fan of their tzatziki sauce.  It was a bit runny and tasteless for me.\n\nWhat really turned me off about this place was that we ate lunch here at 3p and Jay's closes at 4p.  Why did the owner and family begin to start cleaning the tables and giving us dirty looks at 3:30 making us feel like it was time to leave?  With their mediocre salad and inhospitality, I humphed my way out of the A/C and into the outside furnace."
1,"I've been to several good Chicago-type places like this, and this one just didn't make the grade for me. Italian beef is my sandwich of choice in this setting, so that's what I picked. The sandwich was pretty good sized, so that's one positive. However, the meat just didn't have any flavor to it, and the onions seemed to have been cooked to death to the point where they were just stringy pieces of nothing.\n\nThe fries weren't bad, but they could have used some seasoning or maybe a little more time in the frier.\n\nI think I'll continue my search for good Italian beef in the area."
0,"Yuck.\n\nWent here today for lunch.  The cashier didn't give me a receipt and I didn't remember the order number he mumbled at me.  \n\nI kept sending my husband up to check to see if the food being randomly handed out was ours, there was a huge group of people standing around also waiting for their food.  After almost 15 minutes our food finally was ready, although I can't understand the delay since neither one of us got any hot food that needed to be cooked.  \n\nThe large Greek Salad ($5.50) I got was horrible.  It was dressed with a red wine vinagrette (???) and was inedible.  What a waste of money.  That was NOT a Greek Salad.\n\nMy husband got the vegetable plate ($9.25) and choked down as much as he could.  The sole piece of Spanokopita (?) was mushy and soggy from sitting in a puddle of some red vinagrette dressing.  The Greek olives were mushy and the bread looked stale.  We picked at our food and finally threw it out in disgust.\n\n(We went to Circle K down the road and each got Hostess cupcakes to snack on instead.)\n\n\nYUCK!!  I won't be back"
0,"This place sucks.  Just got back from lunch after trying it for the first time.  I wanted a pita and greek fries and when I placed my order, the guy charged me for a combo and mumbled a number.  When my order came up, I pointed out to the stupid b*ch giving me my food that I ordered greek fries and she looked at the ticket and said \""well, you paid for a combo, that comes with regular fries\"" and then she shoved the order at me and walked away.  Needless to say, I won't be going back!"
2,Was ok
3,"The place is a bit of a hole in the wall in a sketchy mini strip mall, but don't let that stop you. The food, for the most part is great. Skip the Falafel as that's pretty plain, frozen and deep fried. The gyro or gyro salad are both quality, so is the Chicken. Fries aren't the crispiest, but they'll do. Service is good, the owner is often behind the counter and is very friendly. I'd definitely recommend it."
1,"Food was ok.  Service was bad.  Overwhelmed staff at lunch rush.  After 10 minutes I asked about my takeout order and was (pretty much) scolded not to confuse the guys on the prep line.  Not given receipt or ketchup for my fries.  Although not in the same neighborhood, Athens Gyros in PHX is way better.  And way friendlier.  First time, last time."
1,"This place is not attractive from the outside so I was hesitant to go in. It was very clean inside and noticed it as a family run business. Food is okay, my gyro was served cold to even with a lunch order for 6 people. Service is friendly when not busy."
3,"Thought the gyros were damn delicious, and pretty cheap too. Nothing ground breaking, but definitely flavorful. If I still worked over there, it'd definitely be a top lunch spot for me. Nice to find some non-chain places for lunch break."
4,"I absolutely adore little hole in the wall LOCAL restaurants like this! The inside was super clean and the food was delicious! We shared the falafel plate, which was plenty for the 2 of us. While we were there the owner was preparing and taking pictures of different food items for the menu. No stock pictures for Jay's Gyro's!! \nAlso, I didn't have the gyro meat, but I did note that it was roasting on the vertical rotisserie - proper! I'll def be back here again!"
0,"This place is a dump. I got hepc just waiting for my chicken kabob salad which took 20 minutes. Salad dressing I think was dirty dishwater, the lettuce was collected from the floor from under the prep area.  \nChicken was burned so the taste of burnt hair lasted in my mouth all day. \n\nEveryone who works there hate their lives from what I can gather very rude, and have the personality of a dishrag. \n\nIf you like 3rd world fast food this port-o-potty is the stop."
2,"I'm not one to write a review by only one visit. Don't let the exterior fool you. This place has been remodeled and is fairly clean. As for their Gyro it is ok. It is your typical Gyro Shop with an descent meat, house made tzatziki, and a cheap pita. My search still continues to find a Gyro that compares to the first Gyro I have had. I will return to this shop to try their other sandwiches but, will most likely pass on their Gyro."
4,"They picked up my documents, and got them to the mortgage company before the promised delivery time. I would use them again. Website is easy to use as well."
1,"How good can the review be...it's a franchise sub shop.  Non of them really make a \""great\"" sub but then again I'm a little biased as I've had many \""hoagie's\"" while visiting the east coast.  My only complaint about this place is the last time I checked they are not open in the evenings.  If you're going to build a location in what some people consider (wrongly) a less than desirable location then have the balls to keep it open with the SAME business hours as your other locations.  When you restrict your hours because you are to afraid of your neighborhood you alienate me and I take my business ELSEWHERE. Don't let racism dictate your business hours because it certainly doesn't dictate where I spend my money and so far you haven't received much of it since you aren't open in the evenings like the rest of your entire chain of restaurants."
1,"If I want a chain style sandwich I would opt for Cheba Hut.\n\nThis place is just okay.  Not much better than Subway in my opinion.\n\nNice that they slice the meat fresh.  I thought the sourdough bread was a bit hard and stale tasting.  The avocado was browning a bit.   No fresh brewed tea.\n\nI thought the sandwhich was a bit pricey even with no drink, chips, salad, cookie, ect.\n\nI don't intend to go back."
2,"This is another one of those reviews where I wish I could leave half stars. Since I can't, I'm giving it a lower grade because I just don't think it's worth 4 stars. For lunch, this place definitely hits the spot and tastes good. I have 2 criticisms though. One, I do not understand paying the exact same for a sandwich because their options vary in meat selection and non-meat selections. A turkey and provolone should not cost the same as a meat stuffed with 4-5 different meats. Just sayin. And two, which is my biggest criticism, is they are ONLY OPEN UNTIL 5PM?!?!?! What kind of crap is that?!?! How much business is this place losing by closing so early? I came here for dinner once and was shooed away at the door at 4:59PM. Wow.\n\nAll in all, this place is good and would recommend. Their meat and cheeses are sliced fresh every order and I do like the fact there are 2 separate counters for ordering. Prices are also reasonable, way better than Jersey Mike's. Location here isn't awesome, it's a little hidden off Broadway and 48th street. It's next to Papa John's so when you see that, turn into the complex with Staples.  It's minutes from work so I am somewhat of a regular here. Will keep coming back because it's yummy!"
4,"Awesome store! I'm an avid Port of Subs fan and this is by far the best location I've been to. They always clean the slicer when I order a veggie sandwich, no other store has ever offered to do this. They have two lines so service is always quick even during the lunch hour. The staff is impressive, sandwiches are always accurate, neat, and made quick. A fantastic place to have a meal hands down!"
1,This place is delicious!! The food was wonderful but the delivery driver was rude and unprofessional. I thought I placed a tip on the card but it didn't go through. The driver when leaving asked if he there was a tip for him. When I stated I left one on the card he replied no do I get one. \n\nBesides for this the food is delicious and I will eat another location.
0,"Please save yourself. Don't do business with these people.\n\nIf I could give a negative star I would. I write this review to warn others and to try and spare you the headaches that we have experienced.  You are welcome to contact me with any questions and I am happy to share any documentation you would care to see.\n\nSo here is what happened:\n\nWe had Troy Lowe, Field Supervisor and the sales guy out to look at some windows for replacement on a home we had purchased.  Our first experience was good, we got a good price and they were able to provide us with the custom windows we wanted.  \n\nWe decided to move forward and Troy was scheduled to come back out and remeasure the windows just to make sure everything was right before fabrication.  Troy never showed.  Instead, we were assured that they had what they needed.  About two weeks later we got a call that our windows were in.  We scheduled installation.  \n\nThe windows were installed on November 10th.  The crew was polite, helpful and careful around our newly installed landscaping.  During installation a problem arose.  The windows, while custom made, were not the proper depth.  After installation, there was a 1/2\"" to 5/8\"" gap all the way around each of the windows.  A 1/4\"" or less is standard.  I had three construction guys out to take a look, including a licensed general contractor and every one told us that the window were either measured wrong, made wrong or installed wrong - the gap was too big to caulk and would need drywall and joint compound.  \n\nWe called True View on the 11th and talked to our customer service rep, Rebecca, to let then know about our concerns and to work with them to get it resolved.  Rebecca assured us that our happiness and customer satisfaction was paramount to the company.  We assured Rebecca that we were happy to work with them to achieve a solution that worked for both sides.  If we could find a way to fix the gap on the inside we were fine to keep the windows. We understand the cost of re-fabricating the windows and our goal was not to put a local business out of business.  \n\nThe four weeks that followed have been a trial of patience, rudeness, lies and excuses from Troy and True View Windows and Glass.  We have been completely renovating a house for 14 months and this is by far the most offensive contractor that we have dealt with. The lack of integrity and transparency has been shocking.\n\nTroy, Field Supervisor was scheduled again to come out and take a look at the problem.  Troy never showed up and never called to say he wasn't coming.  I called again and this time Troy called me as said that he didn't need to come out and not to worry they would take care of the problem.  \n\nA couple days later two guys showed up with about 45 tubes of caulk.  The guys told us point blank they were instructed to caulk the windows and nothing more.  We stopped the guys and told them that caulk was not a suitable solution.  They told us that is all they had and again told use they were instructed only to caulk.  We asked them not to waste their time or caulk given the caulk around the South facing windows would have to be replaced every one to two years or so.  We didn't bargain for windows that would need that kind of maintenance every year or two.  We were looking for a solution that would last as long as the windows - a permanent solution. \n\nThe next two weeks was a comedy of cat and mouse as we tried and tried to get True View to come out and finish the job as promised.  There was always some excuse and finally I had to threaten to have the credit card charge reversed to get them to move.  Finally on 12/7/11 Troy showed up with some metal \""U\"" channels and said they could glue them to the fronts of the windows to cover over the gap.  That just wasn't an acceptable solution and not what we had previously agreed to.  I guess Troy doesn't know that open air space around your windows is bad for the HVAC bill, especially when it is 114 degrees.  \n\nWe called True View the next day and explained that we had a painter on-site that would do the repair with drywall, etc. for $330.  True View refused stating they preferred to have their own people do the work.  We said fine and asked when they could come out.  Amazingly every day we were available - they were not.  \n\nIn the end, we will replace the windows with windows that actually fit the opening from a reputable company.  We will have the True View Windows carefully removed and will ask the Contractor's Board to instruct True View to come get their windows as part of our formal complaint to be file this week.  If the installation was this bad, we can only image the nightmare a warranty item would bring.  It never cease to amaze me, especially in this economy, how foolish people can be.  With so may good businesses going out of business it is a shame to see a bottom feeder like this still in business."
3,"Maybe there was just one bad apple?  I had a great experience with True View.  The phone customer service, follow-up, follow-through and on-the-spot estimates within just a few minutes of calling.  \n\nThe person showed up on time to measure, was friendly and quick (must not have been Troy!) The installation went smooth.  The price was good.  Easy does it for us.  My only disappointment was that I wished they had color selections to view on their website or in-person."
4,Called several companies and this was the lowest quote by far. Setting up the install was easy and Chris from True View did a great job!
1,"Very unorganized.  I had received multiple quotes and conflicting information regarding not only price, but time frame to have glass made and installed.   I will never use or refer anyone to this company.  Great customer service, poor execution.\n\n\n\n\nA few weeks back I had to smash my window in my house because I locked my keys in my car.(this was a tuesday)  If it wasn't for the fact that I had to make a flight within an hour I would have called a locksmith.  Long story short, I made arrangements with several companies to come and do a estimate for window replacement.  They all informed me that there would be a 3-5 day wait for the window replacement.  I called True View Windows and they informed me that I would have same day service to include glass replacement.  WOW!  I canceled all the other companies that were scheduled come out.  \nThe next day (wed) I had a technician come to my house to measure the window, he informed me that it would have to be custom made.  So, obviously same day service was NOT an option. He told me 3-5 days.  While he was there I had him measure my windows for screens, I thought I was going to have it done anyways, why not kill two birds with one stone.  Jeff, the technician was very professional and friendly.  He measure all my windows and gave me samples of screening to play with.  We were talking about the 80% and 90% screens.  He informed me there would be no difference in the price if I chose either.  So, he did the measurements same day.  Again he was very professional and friendly.  \nThe next day (Thursday) I got a call from TRUE VIEW.  Got the time frame (3-5) business days for windows and an estimate for screens.  Screens were really highly priced 3 little block windows 12\""12\"" (approx 1 sq ft each)  were going to be over $350.  In addition to that they told me there was a difference in the price for 80% to 90%.  \nI called on friday to get an idea of when my window was going to be ready.  When I called the woman told me 7-10 business days.  I had already left a deposit with the initial order.  I couldn't believe it.  I was hoping that window would be ready for installation for the following TUE- WED, I had cleared those two days.What happned to 3-5 business days? Well, those days weren't an option either.  Friday was the only day it could be done.  I told them I had a 5pm flight to catch on friday and if I could have an early morning appt.  They said it wasn't possible because the TECH has another apt that day.  Do they only have 1 technician?   My suggestion is get estimates and use another company.  As much as I appreciate great, friendly customer service, great service doesn't make up for my financial loss (rearranging schedule) or frustration"
3,"I had contacted 2 other possibilities for doing my shower glass installation. 1 gave me 2 different prices for the same work, the other didn't return calls.\nTrue View was professional, walk through questions patiently and when it came time for the installation; they were on time and completed the job in one visit.\nI am really happy with the service and product I received. Yep, I recommend them."
0,So far taking four times to fix patio door that they just put new rollers on an had to cut a little off the top. Would not recommend these people unless you want to keep calling them back .
4,"After a failed attempted autoglass replacement by another company earlier this week, I asked the insurance company about Auto Glass Excellence. A coworker used them recently and received good service and a quick response. Like Bill D., I too have State Farm and it was no problem handling the insurance claim.\n\nIn speaking with the representative, I set the appointment up to arrive at my office in the morning. The technician called a few minutes before he arrived and explained the process when I took him to the vehicle. About 45 minutes later he was finished and called to indicate it was ready. Quick, painless and quality installation. My coworker, who used to own an autoglass company, stated the glass used was higher quality than the one used by the dealers and he was impressed with the work. My friend went to a web site showing glass company performance. There were only 6 companies on the list with perfect scores - and AGE was one of the companies. They have a great history and based on the installation today, they continue to provide quality service."
4,"I couldn't believe it... I finally got my first cracked windshield last month. A quiet, unassuming little \""tink\"" sound and that was enough to start a crack that spanned the width of my windshield. Obviously an event to truly make anyone's day. So I turned to Yelp looking for some recommendations and came across these guys. Good reviews! So I called them and a few other places for some quotes and they came in as the lowest and stated they used glass from the same manufacturer that my original windshield was from. On top of that they were friendly and quite helpful. Sold!\n\nThe day came and I have to say I definitely picked the right people. Installation was a breeze, the tech was awesome and didn't mind my hanging out and watching (hey... I've never seen how this stuff gets done) while talking about video games and anything else. SUPER friendly, SUPER qualified. I couldn't be happier."
0,I had the worst experience with this company. My insurance recommended them and from the beginning I didn't want to use their service because it was very difficult to get in touch with them. No one answered the phone during business hour and when I left a message they never contacted me back. When they finally were suppose to come out to my home and replace my windshield not only were they late from our scheduled time but the employee was very rude. He rushed the job and finished in half an hour and left the glass dirty with glue stuck to it. One of the worst experiences with a company I have ever had. I will never use their service again and I warn anyone who might.
3,"Just gonna get this out of the way - this Hampton Inn is old.  The building is aging.  The rooms are showing wear.  It's not dirty... but if you're expecting new furniture and modern design, best to look elsewhere.\n\nThe location is fantastic.  Highway 143 ends right next to the hotel and there is incredibly easy access to I-10, both North and South.  Getting to the airport is equally easy.  There isn't much nearby in walking distance - there is a strip mall about a block away from some food and shopping and, if you're an Anaheim Angels fan, their Spring Training stadium Tempe Diablo is a pretty easy 15-20 minute walk away.\n\nThe parking situation on site is iffy, but the way the hotel is shaped (into a L), there are three entrances, so if you park to the entrance closest to your room, it breaks up the parking crowding.  Be warned, though, that the elevators are all at the corner of the L.\n\nThe rooms are pretty spartan, but clean.  LCD TVs in each room, which are not locked out so you can plug in a game console or other entertainment device via HDMI.  None of the stations are in HD, however  Work desk, minifridge, microwave.  The in-hotel Wi-Fi was on the slower side - 0.4Mb/s down, roughly the same up - and the signal for both Verizon and AT&T were fussy and affected by the proximity to traffic on I-10, especially at rush hours.\n\nThe complimentary breakfast is more of the same, but the seating area is small on busy mornings, I had to take my food back to the room.  Food options are the 3 hot food items (usually some sort of entree paired with some combination of sausage, bacon, eggs, or potatoes).  Waffle station, toast/bagels, yoghurt, juice machine, hard-boiled eggs... if you've done breakfast at Hampton, you know what you're in for.\n\nOverall, it's a perfectly fine hotel.  It's further from downtown Phoenix, it's older, and it's not in the greatest area, so rates tend to be on the lower side.  Staff here is largely friendly and helpful.  For what it is and it's proximity to areas east and south of Phoenix, it's a solid place to stay while in town."
0,Worst customer service ever!! I have been waiting all day for someone to come to my house from 2-4 and no one showed up so I called and they said oh sorry we have been busy! Excuse me you couldn't of even called me and told me that you weren't coming?!? Not happy with them at all and if I would of read the other reviews before hand I wouldn't of picked them anyways this place SUCKS!!!!!
0,"This is one of the worst companies I've ever dealt with. I called them on a Sunday for a leak that we had from a line in the attic at our rental property. They called me back and smoothly said Sure, no problem, we'll be there first thing tomorrow morning. The tech called me at 7:44am the next morning, and began badgering me about how bad of a problem it was, it's all the tenants fault for not changing the filter, etc. and ranting about how it will cost me $800 to fix the coil in the attic, it needs an acid wash, etc. \n\nI arrived there 20 minutes later, took a look at the filters (they weren't even that dirty), and based on that and his abuse, said no thanks, I'm not going to do it. He started to challenge me on paying for the service call, and when I said sorry, you'll have to bill me for it, he looked defeated and walked out the door. \n\nI called another company (one I've dealt with before), and they fixed it for $195. \n\nDON'T get suckered into using these guys, they were bullies, and pretty dishonest. I'll never use them again."
0,"I would like to truly provide a review but I have been trying to get an appointment for a quote for 3 weeks.  Yes, an appointment to get a quote.  Called them several times and they told me they are busy.  But, they said I could call them back to remind them to call me if I would like.  Are you FLIPPING kidding me!?!?!?!  With that kind of customer service they will not be busy for very long.  Not trying to be mean but there are too many options out there to receive this type of response."
0,Collum Roofing installed a roof at a commercial project in Chandler AZ- we have now been trying to schedule a warranty repair for over a month without any response.  The promised return phone calls never come ...don't hold your breathe...go else where!
0,"I had a complete opposite experience with the Vet Neurology Center.  After keeping us waiting for over 8 hours for X-rays and an MRI (a process that should have taken 2-3 hours at most), and charging us exhorbitant amounts of money, they did nothing to help our dog.  I supposed there was really nothing they could do.  But forcing her to spend her final hours in their depressing building was unnecessary, I believe.\n\nAnd they could have at least faked a bit of compassion.  We sat for hours in their sterile waiting room, worried and wondering.  The receptionists acted like we were just a bother to them.  The doctor promised he would call and follow-up.  We are still waiting for that call.\n\nIt was an awful experience.  If you can avoid the Vet Neurological center, you should, IMO.  You may have no choice if your regular vet suggests an MRI.  But be prepared to be treated without compassion.  And bring your life savings.  You may need that -- and more.\n\nGood luck.  I hope your experience is better than ours was."
0,"As an update, more than three weeks have passed, and we still have not received a follow-up call from the doctor.  The only vet we have ever had who failed to follow-up...  I'm disappointed, but not surprised.  And frankly, after all we've been through, we would rather not talk to him again."
3,"At first glance, my Yelp buddies may be thinking \""Finally!  She's put the lid on that can of crazy and adopted a new pet!  Too bad it needs a neurologist.\""  Well, no I haven't. That shows you what my list of unfinished reviews looks like.  So here's my review from my August 2011 visit.  Rest assured, it was so traumatizing I can accurately remember the pertinent details.\n\nAfter my kitty suffered a severe seizure, losing her eyesight, the emergency clinic recommended a neuro consult as they were unable to pinpoint the cause.    So we loaded up our already deaf, now blind, and extremely pissed off family member into the car and  headed from one hospital to another.\n\nThe facility is in an odd industrial area, but it was very clean and the staff friendly.  We were greeted promptly and had a minimal wait.  Suzi was first thoroughly examined by an resident.  She was minimally cooperative, but he was good with her.  He then took her to another room for a second examination by a neurologist, Dr. Evans.  We were not offered the opportunity to accompany Suzi, but we were not exactly at the top of her list anyway.  Following Dr. Evan's exam, he did meet with us to report his findings.  His best guess was a brain tumor, but in absence of an MRI, he could not be certain.  We discussed treatment options; however, as she was already 19, I was not willing to consider surgery or radiation.  He suggested a course of steroids which could reduce any swelling causing the blindness.\n\nThe only thing preventing me from a 5-star review was the topic of the MRI.  While I did not feel pressured, I was encouraged to move forward with it for a definitive diagnosis even after I expressed concern over her age and current weakened state following the seizures.  I asked if the MRI were positive what conservative treatment was available.  The answer...a course of steroids, the same thing if it were negative.  I fully understand it was their obligation to communicate all available diagnostics and treatments available, but I also understand that I could have easily been swayed to spend $3000 just for peace of mind in my case.\n\nThe steroids did appear to help as Suzi's sight returned and she had 3 more months seizure-free.  Dr. Evans' best guess diagnosis appeared to be accurate, as she did exhibit additional symptoms pointing to a brain tumor just before we euthanized her.  I would not hesitate to trust this facility again should the need arise."
4,"My dog Scooby has ruptured his discs 4 times, but only requiring surgery twice.  Both times the doctors and staff were very good and caring. Scooby's surgery was expensive, but worth it.  The back surgery they do there on herniated discs is like a miracle, I recommend it if your dog has this problem.  I am so grateful for their care (most especially to Dr. Schissler who is very kind) and so grateful there is a vetrinary neurologist in Phoenix.  Your pet will be in good hands here."
0,"I brought my pug to see Dr. Plummer in April 2014 after receiving a referral from my regular vet. Please note that I am not leaving this negative review because of the pricing - I wouldn't expect a neurological veterinarian to be cheap. I also cannot say that the office staff was unfriendly - in fact they were wonderful. My negative review is simply due to Dr. Plummer and the service my pug received from him. Kaluha (my pug) had lost feeling in her back legs, she was still able to walk but her reactions were just very slow & it was getting worse as time passed. She was also beginning to have difficulty feeling when she had to poop. When I bought her in to see Dr. Plummer he had started by first ruling out degenerative myelopathy which I appreciated because I'd hate to think I paid $3,000 for an MRI when a $300 test could've proven it was this disease all along. However, that test came back negative so the only other option was go through with the MRI. It's fair to say that I wouldn't pay this much money for an MRI unless I was also ready to pursue surgery resulting in another $3,000. However, in making the decision to continue with surgery I wanted to be sure that this would help her gain function in her back legs. Dr. Plummer could not guarantee that she would regain function but she wouldn't get any worse & that was a key point in my decision making. Maybe this surgery wouldn't bring my Kaluha back to the way she was but I knew she wouldn't lose complete function so I went through with the surgery. Kaluha was given steroids after her surgery and I certainly didn't expect a quick turnaround but after 1 month and seeing her still struggling I called & asked Dr. Plummer why we weren't seeing any improvement. He put her back on the steroids but this still didn't help at which point I was starting to believe she would be that \""unlikely possibility of never regaining function\"". This was upsetting for me but the purpose of the surgery was that Kaluha would not get worse. Well Kaluha has gotten progressively worse since her surgery in April. Now she can't even feel when she has to urinate! Worse yet, she can't hold herself up when she has to urinate so I have to hope that I am near & can hold her up so she doesn't get stuck in it. I brought her back in to show Dr. Plummer that she has gotten worse & he couldn't figure out why this would happen. In fact he told me that it is now time to consider getting her a doggy wheel chair because of her deteriorating condition. He had absolutely no intention on trying to determine what went wrong after I paid $6,000 for a surgery not for a guarantee that she'd get better but for the peace of mind in knowing she wouldn't get worse. He told me I could pay for another MRI to see what's going on... another MRI?! Oh but he was kind enough to offer a 50% discount on this second MRI! Now I guess the only thing I can do for Kaluha is to watch for when I start to see her have signs of pain so that I know it's time to put her down.  The only thing I received from going through all of this is knowing that I tried everything I could for Kaluha even though Dr. Plummer gave up after he collected his fee."
4,"I bought a conference table and chairs a few months ago from AZ Office Liquidators, and feel like I got a great deal on great furniture.  This month, I purchased 10 refurbished office cubes from the company, and I couldn't be more satisfied.  \n\nLorraine designed our floor plan, sourced high-quality units in good condition, repainted shelves at no cost, and coordinated a no-hassles installation.   I'd make AZ Office Liquidatiors your first and last stop for office furniture."
0,"Nice products/Unsatisfactory service\n\nDecided not to go forward in purchasing office furniture from them after several days of not receiving a quote for the items I wanted to purchase. I called them each morning for an update and each day I was told that I would receive a quote in 45 minutes, finally received an email minus the quote on the 3rd day.\n\nHaving been in sales for the last 15 years I have a hard time wrapping my head around how any business would ignore an opportunity to make 7-10K from a single transaction."
4,"I have been using Mark's luggage for years. This is the best luggage repair shop in the valley, a consensus my friends (all pilots,) and I reached a while ago. As a professional pilot I live out of my roll-aboard for half the year. Inevitably I need to have my luggage fixed, and at Mark's it is always expertly done, very quick at super reasonable prices."
3,"Marks Luggage is professional, fast, and does a great job for a fair price. What more can you ask for, the luggage repair shop services all kinds of baggage problems.  Mark's Luggage takes credit cards.\n\n1542 E Victory St, Phoenix"
1,"This review is specifically about Tumi Warranty repair.  \n\nMark's is a preferred repair service for Tumi.  I recently sent a Tumi bag from Seattle for repair.  This briefcase was sold to me as having a lifetime warranty.  \n\nA side zipper failed, one that is used a lot, and Mark's determined it failed due to \""damage\"".  Not only was this completely  untrue, but self-serving for both Marks (they priced the repair at $60) and Tumi (who don't honor original warranties).\n\nMark's may be great at luggage repair but serving Tumi like this is not in their customers' best interest, IMO."
4,"I registered for Travel Pro luggage when I got married several years ago.\nThe bags have been really sturdy, lasting through a honeymoon, a few vacations, and a move across country.\n\nI needed to have a bit of repair work on them before our next trip, and looked on the travel pro website for an authorized repair shop.\nThe only one in the Phoenix area that was authorized, is Mark's Luggage.\nI hesitated for a couple of days only because of the distance; but figured the bags have been good to me, so it was worth the drive.\n\nWhat was even better was they are open on Saturday until Noon.\n\nService was GREAT. Very friendly-and promised our bags in week or so.\nOur bags were done in a couple of days!! Even better, our warranty covered the repair (who knew)?!! again, so glad I went with an authorized repair shop.\nEasy pick up and no nonsense service. I'll be going to Mark's for any future luggage repairs."
3,"I'm from california and recently got back a Tumi briefcase I asked them to repair (ripped linings and broken zipper) and while they did make the best of what was given (the briefcase was extremely used/old), they forgot to patch up some of the inside pockets!\n\nBut when calling them again, they told me that they would be more than happy to stitch it all back up again as long as I remembered to label what needed to get fixed, and then offered to pay for the shipping!"
0,"Dropped off 2 pieces of luggage at Mark's Luggage, 1 needing repair of the wheels and zippers and the other one requiring replacement. I was told that the repairs would be complete in about 3 weeks and the replacement would be sent to my home about the same time. Well after 7 weeks, I called Mark's and was told they hadn't received the parts from Delsey. As for the replacement, they stated that they sent the request to Delsey. I was also told that they would follow up with Delsey and call me back the next day. Well it has been 1 more week and no call from Mark's and no replacement luggage from Delsey. Needless to say, customer service is not a strong point. I am leaving on a trip in 2 weeks and will probably need to purchase new luggage.\nVery unhappy with Mark's."
4,"Have sent in my Bric's bag 3 times now. It is like an extended part of the family. I travel some 3-5 a month so they know how to bring this bag back to life. They are prompt, professional, and do a great job! I would recommend them to anyone."
4,"It is always a good sign when you enter a new place and one of the customers waiting in line randomly tells you \""they are always busy, they do such an amazing job.\""  \n\nSo my strap broke on my Italian leather Flotos bag/brief that I use for work.  It was a $400 investment I made 2 years ago and I was not thrilled to repurchase a new bag.  Since I was moving out of state in a week and knew my last few days would be crazy-busy, they provided the option of shipping the bag free of charge.  I received the bag yesterday and they were able to match the leather and it even looks sturdier than the original design.  I could be imagining things but the leather exterior also looks like it had been polished.  I'm so glad to have found this place and only paid $20 to fix the bag with free shipping (which is much better than a $400 replacement)."
4,"This place is great. I had an emergency since I was traveling and in town for 4 days. I lost a wheel on a Sampsonite  bag and I only had 2 days for them to repair the bag since they are closed Fri and Sat.  They only took a day and a half and could not have been nicer. It you need a bag repaired, this is the place."
2,"A friend introduced me to this place for lunch. the other day and I'm so glad he did. It's off the beaten path but that doesn't seem to have hurt their traffic. They offer breakfast and lunch and have a pretty loyal crowd, but they're happy to see new faces too.\n\nI had the tuna melt on Parmesan bread yum. The tuna is mixed with diced celery and sweet pickles, and it comes with bacon and Swiss (I 86ed the tomatoes ... big surprise). The french fries were fantastic! My friend went with the Thursday lunch special, which was beef burgundy tips over egg noodles (aka stroganoff), and didn't say a word from the time he leaned until his plate until it was all but licked clean. \n\nDrinks are self serve and I like that they brew their own ice tea - it's the good dark, teeth-staining ice tea that I loooooove.\n\nTo call this place a \""greasy spoon\"" wouldn't do it justice. And, it definitely deserves a return visit."
2,"A decent lunch spot with restaurant service in a fairly industrial area.  I would give the wait staff and atmosphere 4+ stars as it is a very comfortable little restaurant to have lunch at, whether it is with co-workers, business associates, friends or by yourself.  However, for the food I'm giving if 3 stars - nothing wrong with the food, but nothing great with it either.  Decent diner food, not many options to eat too healthy too (you need to be creative if you're watching calories!).  I eat there a few times a month typically, so I definitely recommend."
4,Very good food. Stopped for breakfast on a rainy morning on a friends reccomendation. Great food and very friendly service. I would recommend to anyone and can't wait till I am in the area again. Best hash in town.
3,"I have now been to this restaurant 5 times. I have taken my staff, my wife, a client, a vendor and just stopped for breakfast one day.  Always good, always friendly! It is also always very busy so go early; it is worth the hunt to find it."
3,"It may be tough to find, and the lunch service may take just a stitch over an hour, but Peppersauce is the best homestyle greasy spoon south of the airport.\n\nNestled in an industrial neighborhood, Peppersauce is the perfect blend of kitsch and delish that a old school cafe should be. The service style is a bit different--you generally don't wait to be seated, but can grab a table and your own drinks before being waited on. Service is spotty and definitely diner-esque, but the girls are very friendly.\n\nThere is really only one item on the menu that i order...the veggie reuben. It is a delicious mountain of sauerkraut topped with cheese and dressing on perfectly-grilled, buttery rye. It definitely ranks in the top ten sandwiches of all time for me. The fries, are ok, and the side salad is pretty good too.\n\nIf you are willing to navigate the industrial park to find it, you should give peppersauce a try."
3,"I love Peppersauce!! It is a cozy little nook right by my office where I can get a hearty breakfast for really inexpensive. They have a little store front set up in the front of the restaurant where you can buy unique gifts. The food, service and ambiance is great at Peppersauce and I will defiantly be back!"
4,"Peppersauce Cafe is one of my favorite places to eat. Though there are many amazing dishes here, my favorite is the pulled pork sandwich. It is topped with onion rings and is FANTASTIC!. I discovered this restaurant about 3 years ago when I was working in the area. I have taken many customers and friends there for lunch. It's a real home cooked meal for just over the price of what you would get fast food. The staff is courteous and remembers who you are. I think that's important for businesses.  Anyhow, Peppersauce gets two thumbs up from me!"
2,"It was just okay.\n\nI didn't have a hard time finding it.  The house/building isn't as cute as say Cibo or House of Tricks.\n\nMy husband and I shared a breakfast burrito with green chilies, tomatoes and peppers added to it.  It was edible but I have had better.  He had a side of fresh corn beef hash.  He didn't seem thrilled with it.\n\nThe service was great.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back though.  That makes me sad because it is a breakfast/lunch place near my home so I really wanted to love it."
4,"This cafe is sort of hidden away and only open until 2pm but it's great. Real friendly staff, and delicious food. I recommend the Peppersauce burger."
0,"I went there with my friend who really likes it.  I ordered  an $8.50 Reuben that had three wafer-thin slices of corned beef wadded into a ball in the middle to provide the illusion that there was some beef on the sandwich.  I pointed this out to my not-so-friendly server when she queried my satisfaction with the meal.  She said, in a snotty put-upon voice, \""Well, we weight the meat for every sandwich!  Every sandwich gets four ounces!\""  It was clear this one was way under and when I pointed this out she said, \""do you want more meat?\""  I asked if I was going to be charged - she said \""Yes!\""  I said no thanks and now my mission is to dissuade anyone who cares from ever going to this place."
2,"Went for lunch. It was pretty busy so service is slightly slow, took a little over an hour for lunch. \nThe food is a little overpriced for what it is, but the quality is good. I got the grilled tuna steak salad. The tuna steak itself was a little over done and dry, and the salad was mostly iceberg lettuce, but it was passable. A little heavy on the cheese, but there were grapes in the salad and that was a nice touch. \nMy friend got the Thursday special, beef tips over noodles. He goes Thursday almost every week so, needless to say, he's a huge fan. \nI would note, if you want a quick lunch pick somewhere else for sure."
2,"This is a decent place to grab lunch.  It's a converted house in an industrial area with not too many other options from what I could tell.  Not a ton of parking.  Plenty of tables and seating inside, much bigger than I expected.  It is VERY loud in there, definitely not the place for intimate conversation.  \nThe service is friendly and fast, my butt had barely hit the chair when they were trying to take my order.  Really quick with the drink refills and bringing the food out.\nThe food was average.  I got the meatloaf sandwich, a huge slab on meatloaf, provolone, on texas toast (is it wrong to call it texas toast in Arizona? ;) )  I thought the sandwich was plenty big, but a bit bland...lots of hot sauce came into play.  The potato salad was good.\nI would come here for a quick, gutbomb lunch.  I would also bring clients here for a quick, fun, downhome meal.\n***Update - This has become my go-to-spot for a quick lunch and I will say that the Pablano Turkey Sandwich is my favorite menu item."
2,Food was adequate.  Staff were nice.
1,"My wife and I eat here frequently and the quality has gone down lately.  I had the Meatloaf and it was not so good.  That visit was a couple of weeks ago.  This last week we stopped for lunch and I ordered a burger.  The patty tasted like the frozen ones you buy at Safeway.  Really??  Come on guys, put some effort into it.  It was tough and tasted like it had been frozen.   \n\nPeppersauce could be a great place but it seems like they are cutting corners......"
3,At first glance and the area its in your like I am not going in there! but man what a surprise!! food was great and the staff was friendly. great place for lunch!
3,"Stopped by for lunch,,, 1st lunch at this place and i have to say ,, The Teriyaki Shroomer was delicious !!! \n\nA tad greasy at the begining, but awesome flavor,,, def a goto lunch spot ,,,, \n\nThanks again to the staff there,, !!! great job.."
3,"Our team chose this place to have breakfast 2nd year in a row before our team build activity. I guess we spend so much time together we're starting to think alike because all 6 of us ordered the same thing, the chicken fried steak, gravy & eggs! Six people can't be wrong, we all cleaned our plates! I thought it was better than my usual favorite go to restaurant for chicken fried steak breakfast. This place appears to be a little hole in the wall Cafe but it was certainly busy, has great food and service to match,  one of those tucked away places that is a must try!"
1,I have been here several times because it is a favorite go to place at my company due to its proximity.\n\nThey are open for breakfast and lunch only. The lunch food for me has been consistently terrible. \n\nI cannot recommend it for lunch.
0,"Walked in at 3 minutes past 2 and was told they were closed. I said it was 2 and they told me \""Too Bad\"" I said I just wanted something to go and I was told the kitchen was already shut down. Is this how they treat customers? I will tell everyone not to ever go there."
0,"At first I was really impressed with the prices and ideas they had to offer. I guess you get what you pay for. The crew showed up with a dead drill and tried to leave. I had to give them one of my drills and they still had to come back a week and a half later because the lock they put on was not the correct lock. On top of those head aches the welding is fair at best. My gate is black, the hinges and other random spots were steel, they spray painted about half the steel, when I pointed out the spots they missed they left me the paint can and told me I could touch it up my self. Truly disappointed."
0,"I would give zero stars if possible. These people are awful at returning phone calls. Over the course of 6 weeks I called 4 times to get someone to look at my iron gate and no one ever called me back. If they tell you a sales person will call you back just forget it, find someone else. I can't even rate their work because they can't even return a call. GET IT TOGETHER!!!!! By the way a minimum of $650 charge for any repairs----you can get a new gate for that!!! Ridiculous."
0,"Terrible customer service! I was contacted in a timely fashion to set up an appt for the salesperson to come out and measure (Andrew). He had terrible reading and listening skills and even worse customer service. I was requesting interior work for a custom wrought iron gate at the top of my stairs to protect my son. Andrew seemed surprised it was for the interior of my house, came out and acted as if he didn't want the business and we should get a regular baby gate (and if that worked we already would have done it!), and I also requested pricing to re-powder coat and modify our existing railing and he paid no attention to this. The receptionist followed up with me to verify I received my bid and if I'm ready to move forward (I didn't receive anything and I had to follow up with the sales guy!) and I sent a lengthy email back about how disappointed I was. She apologized and said Jim the owner would be in touch with me. Ha! She sent me a message this morning referring me to a baby proof company. No name, just a number. Seems like this business is getting to big for their britches! Use someone else! This valley is full of competitors who will provide you with good customer service!\n\nAnd when I do out my pool in they won't get my business either!"
3,"The company did a nice job installing my fence and it looks good.  I especially appreciated Andrew's attention to detail when it came to preparing the bid, measurements, and explaining to me the variations in materials and the entire process.  I also appreciate that he was conscious of my budget and worked with me on that.  The company would have gotten five stars, but the install was a day later than what they agreed to."
4,"I wanted to upgrade the Audio System for my Nordic Boat and it presented some challenges. The results were excellent. They provided a very reasonable price and installed the 2 JL Audio Amps, 2 10 Subs, and 6 7.7 Speakers as well as adding an IPOD control cable. They took excellent care of my boat - seamless. Very satisfied with David and his Crew!!!"
4,"These guys are top notch. I took my classic car car in here and they designed me a oem looking system that would blow any new car's upgraded system out of the water. They met and exceeded all of my expectations. They showed me a few other projects they were working on, and it was evident that these guys really know their stuff."
4,Dave and the Sound Xpression team is the best. Their customer service and attention to detail is outstanding!!!! I am so happy with the work they did on my 2014 Ford Focus!!!! Highly recommend if you are looking for car/truck audio and installation this is definitely the place to go. Thank you again!!!
3,"Great value for the money!... great staff, free wifi, and very close to the airport. When i booked the room i was a little worried because it was so close to the airport but you cant hear anything. The only reason why i do not rate it a 5 is because there is no pool or fitness area. But for the price you really cant beat it! Plus a really friendly front desk girl understood our concern for not wanting to pay for a full night since we were coming in at 4 AM and she allowed us to stay that half night for free (even when we were willing to pay something for the night she said dont worry about it get here safely) and then we stayed Friday and Saturday. The room could use a little bit of an update, but once again what do you expect when your paying only $50 a night!.... OVERALL GREAT STAY! :D"
1,"The staff here were friendly and I received my room in great condition and everything worked fine.  My stay would have been very positive here had it not been for the erroneous charges on my credit card.  After contacting the Area Operations Manager for HSD Tempe Airport-ESA Phoenix Airport Extended Stay about this charge, the problem still wasn't solved.  I later emailed the corporate office on Extended Stay's website.  I never received any type of response back concerning the bogus charge.  To add insult to injury, they signed my email address up to their mailing list, and now I'm receiving spam from Extended Stay in my inbox.  I will never stay at an Extended Stay again, and will tell my friends to stay clear.  Completely disgusted about getting ripped off $24+.\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nI was finally refunded my $24+, but it took an act of congress for it to happen.  Shame on you Extended Stay!"
1,"Not the best customer service, no house keeping , bathroom wasn't cleaned. Old towels. Good location but be careful if you a sensitive to cigarette smoke.  11/6/2014"
0,"I don't care if this was the last hotel left in Tempe I would not stay here. \n\nWe came here to watch Ironman Arizona two weeks ago and since we live a pretty healthy lifestyle we chose to stay somewhere with a kitchen. Horrible mistake. \n\n1. Customer service - horrible. \n2. Bathroom flooded because of a toilet problem and they wouldn't fix it. We had to fix it ourselves.\n3. Internet only worked with a few things, but wouldn't let us use a lot of main websites that we needed.\n4. Lazy front desk.\n5. We asked to get new towels & wash cloths since we had to use them to soak up the water and nope not one new towel. \n6. we called numerous times to speak to a customer service representative about the problems and we have yet to speak to someone in the department."
4,"I just got a 500 'koosies' from here with my company name on it. (that's flexible little coolers to hold your beer can with).  I know for a fact nobody throws these babies away. I am now giving them out to all my past clients, and they all love it. From now on when they drink a beer they'll be looking at my name and phone #. How great is that! Thank you Total Forms Management. Much more that just 'forms'. They got everything!"
1,"I disagree, this Taco Bell is NOT the best. They FOOL you into THINKING it's the best because they repeat your order back to you in the drive-thru, in the order that  you ordered the items, and then you feel confident that they got it right, then you pull up to the window and they repeat it to you AGAIN, giving you MORE false confidence, and then you check the bag and everything LOOKS right, then you drive all the way home and discover you've got the wrong items, things you didn't order, wrapped to label what you asked for. \nGranted, at the end of the day, it's all the Bell and pretty much the same. So you eat it anyway. But you still harbor resentment for the trickery."
3,"Ok foodies' don't judge me to harshly. Had to meet a coworker for a quick meeting. This store it clean, well run and filled with high profile biz folks in a hurry. \n\nWhile the chain is improving the their reputation globally as possible this store showcases that a fast food chain can deliver in a pinch. Great job."
4,"Lets see if I can write something worth while, as I am still speechless. The shirts Anna and her amazing team at Super Embroidery & Screenprinting made for us, came out insanely awesome! They have exceed every expectation and went above and beyond. The quality of work is so overwhelmingly perfect I am still smiling ear to ear! Thank you thank you thank you! I am so thankful for your company, anyone who orders from you is guaranteed to feel the same."
0,"I was initially very reluctant to do a review because everyone has different experiences and am genuinely a very humble person. Being that I read reviews myself , I ultimately decided I needed to share mine regardless of outcome. \n\nSuper Emb came highly recommended by a friend of mine in the t shirt business about 2 years ago. He spoke of the staff in high regard , so I just knew when my initial inventory came in - Super Emb would be the place to be ! \n\nI brought in 36 shirts to have screen printed. Amber was so courteous and attentive . She even helped me match up most of the colors swatches closest to my design. We spent about 20 min doing this alone . She took all of the appropriate information down and off I was anticipating my call to return. \n\nI was told they would be ready Friday, yet had to return Monday. No big deal right, I was so happy up until then, it just added to the excitement to see my product . \n\nBeing I returned Monday I had a short window as I needed had other errands . I could see my first design through the clear plastic bag and was ecstatic !!! When I paid my  invoice I was told 2 of the shirts were deemed defective and could not be sold. I asked why, the rep I believe her name was Tricia replied \""they had ink on them\"". Again no big deal, that's a part of business right; things happen. She even credited my invoice for the original purchase amount. \n\nI returned home with such eagerness to look at my shirts . First thing I noticed there was quite a bit of black ink on the outside of the bags. Yes of the shirts, perhaps this is why the 2 were defective . I proceed thinking ok let's take a look . 14 of my shirts were dirty ! Some MUCH more than others . They were filled with lint, one had a blue pen mark on it, one had a hole in the sleeve, and the remaining had large smudges of ink around the design . Similar to a half circle , consistent on every shirt . \n\nI immediately called and made Cindy aware 2 hours after pickup . She was very disappointed and advised I come in Tuesday as it was approaching 5:30 and they were closed now. \n\nI return Tuesday and speak with my initial rep ; Amber. She immediately says \""yes this is clearly the PLATEN\"" . Which I already knew ! I show, the pen mark, the lint, the ones that appear to have been on the floor and exclaim that I now simply can't sell shirts . \n\nStan I presume the production/design manager enters . He immediately tells me I brought the shirts in like this . Excuse me ?\nI reply my shirts were brand new, checked upon receipt from the manufacturer . He says who ? I said \""American Apparel\"". \n\""Yes American apparel, figures\"". But AFTER I said the brand. At this point the remaining staffs is actively listening and present . He says an employee showed him (the clearly ink smudges from the platen) at the end of the belt . Of course he did ! Because it happened During the production process! \nWhat business would print knowingly on dirty shirts. NONE. \n\nDirty shirts that I did not bring in, that Cindy didn't see, that no one on the line seen until the END of the belt. Suggesting that your company would do that is laughable . To willingly assume responsibility for something you supposedly know you aren't responsible for, and continue to print insults your own integrity . Mind you no one told me anything until I came back in. \n\nAny-who Anna comes out and agrees that the shirts are dirty, she sees the lint, the ink marks, the pen, etc. Stan suddenly has a change in heart, being she openly yet subtly acknowledges  their error and responsibility . He assures me the shirts will be \""cleaned up\"".I leave still I'm good spirits , confident they will rectify the situation . \n\nI return Wednesday to pick up my shirts . They are visible a bit faded and appear smaller. Sleeves curled at the ends , etc. the stains faintly remain on about 5 of the shirts . I ask Cindy, what did he do ? \""Spray and wash\"" O_O !!!?? I say it looks like he washed them . She replies \""she has no idea what he did\"" but just let it slip that he used spray n wash. Truth sometimes slips, yet it's not your fault. You were a great rep. Not like the floral scented detergent would go unnoticed . \n\nI can't believe you all took me through that just to launder my shirts . I have so much more inventory. I could've been offered a reprint on those or something considerable sufficient to the damaged shirts . I have never known a screen printer to launder someone's brand new inventory . I could've done that myself especially because my children have eczema and I ended up having to launder them AGAIN for wear, as they are clearly not sellable . \n\nI wish you all the best of success yet hope you are more honest and utilize more integrity going forward in rectifying your errors. Ultimately things happen in business. It's not that it happens, it's how you handle it. Poor job."
1,Randomly came here during our roadtrip.  I thought it would be cool to eat here because of its name :P  These burgers taste as bad as a white castle burger. I can't determine which is worse! I'm giving an extra star because of it's unique name!
2,"I have to admit the service was pretty good even though they were understaffed.  They were polite and friendly and the bathrooms were very clean.  The food is just okay and compare it to burger king. I do like you have an option to get onion rings on top of that which is nice, but you pay a little extra.  They deliver the food to you and ask you if you want ketup on top of that.  Anyways it was just okay.  I just do not know why I was craving it."
1,"Whataburger what's the point, I got the Whataburger with cheese, onion rings and drink. It was a long wait, then the server brought out 3 orders at a time and my food was warm not hot. My onion rings where warm and greasy, they do theirs skimpy beer batter style not crunchy at all.  This location is near my job so it could be convenient but I don't know if I would bother since it was so underwhelming."
0,"I don't know why I stopped here for lunch This afternoon. But I do know that I will never eat at a whataburger EVER again!\n\nThis place has some of the most off the wall people working the cash register! This chick took my order; Then dosed off into a trance like stare at my \""yoohoo\"" area... And NO I didn't have anything going on down there or nothing on my pants if that's what your thinking. Seriously though no joke I couldn't believe  what this chick was doing in front of the entire lunch hour rush that was storming in and out...\n\nI looked at her then politely said \""umm hello? Miss, What are you looking at?\"" she came out of her spell and smiled at me with a kinda creepy half smile... Then as I was filling up my drink I caught her doing it AGAIN!\n\nNO I'm not gay and yes I do have standards. This chick was missing half her teeth and was about as old as bob barker.\n\nYeah I literally couldn't even eat cause this chick made me loose my appetite. And the fact that my burger and fries tasted like it was soaked in a bowl of grease then sat under a heat lamp for about 20 minutes. \n\nThey should shut this place down or turn it into a In N Out burger. NEVER AGAIN!"
0,"I'm certainly no burger aficionado, but having eaten at Burger King, McDonald's, In and Out Burger etc., I understand what to expect from greasy, mediocre, fast food. This was not mediocre in any way, but virtually inedible. The only thing I could compare it to is what you used to get out of a vending machine and then proceed to microwave. Absolutely the worst burger I've ever eaten in my life."
1,"The drive through was very quick and service was friendly.\n\nHowever, I could not finish the burger. I took a couple bites and had to quit. There was so much grease. I regret not going to In-N-Out Burger. :-( \n\nThe fries for whatever reason were not over powered in grease and actually were pretty good."
3,"Tasty burger!\n\nI hadn't been to a Whataburger in YEARS, but I was in the area and needed food. \n\nI ordered just a burger and drink. My first thought was that it was a little pricey at a little over $7, but I *did* order a double burger. \n\nThe people working there were very nice, service was fast, and the burger arrived hot and fresh. The double burger was worth the money, and the guy delivering it to my table asked if I needed condiments or a drink refill -- I thought that was nice.\n\nI got the green chile double burger, which consisted of two patties, two slices of cheese and a pile of green chiles on it -- they added a nice little kick. \n\nAs some other reviewers mentioned, the burgers are a bit on the juicy side, so that could be a problem if you're eating in the car or just don't like your burgers that way. Careful, they come out HOT enough to burn your mouth!"
0,"My first and last Whatacrappyburger. Nasty grey patty and one of the heaviest burgers ever. Needed to cook some more once back home, but i could only eat half of this junk before I threw in the towel. Free fries and drink helped soften the blow, but this chain is a disaster. In and Out is way better. I can't believe how bad the burger was, too bad cause they spend alot of money on billboards, but not even on quality food obviously."
1,"You get what you pay for and for what I paid, I guess I shouldn't have expected much more. The food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary for a burger joint. I liked the fries and the small drinks were HUGE.... but isn't that everywhere now a days. A+ for fast and friendly service. Prolly won't visit again--I'd rather go up the street to Micky D's for a Big Mac."
0,"Nasty!  I don't know how people eat here. I ordered the green chile burger and it was tasteless!  How can green chile have no flavor??  None...not even a hint of green chile flavor.  The hamburger itself was gray, tasteless.  The only thing good on the burger was the cheese and it wasn't even melted.  I don't know how they are still in business because it was disgusting.  I would never eat here again.  Not even if I was starving."
3,Staff is always friendly !\n\n\nFood is always fresh and hot! \n\nI am a fast food junkie waiting for my metabolism to catch up to me.\n\nI have had everything from their chicken strips to the burgers and it is always cooked fresh !
2,"Tip: nachos here are bomb, yes gas station nachos. When you want care less about your health, load up on nacho and chili cheese. Also tamales in green chili and horchata at this location."
1,"Place is alright. I was in a hurry and needed gas, but if you get Chevron, you're better off going to the one on Kyrene or Rural on Baseline. A lot cheaper compared to this one."
2,"A popular lunch spot with the local businesses, the G&D II offers pseudo authentic English food at a very fair price. \n\nMost of the edible offerings are reasonably good (although being an ex pat Brit my standards for this kind of dish are probably higher than some), the service is friendly if rather amateur at times (I have experienced waitresses not knowing what mint sauce is when I ask for it). Another benefit is they are always willing to do separate checks.\n\nA spin off from the original G&D on Central Ave, the decor will never be as 'pub like' due to the nature of the building itself, but a fair effort has been made to capture the feeling of a UK pub."
2,"George & Dragon is a good spot for lunch or some peace and quiet during the work day.\n\nThe wait staff is definitely the best part of this bar and grill. Even though my friends and I come here only about once every four or five weeks, the waitresses always remember us, our drink preferences, and what we ordered last time. Actually, that's kind of creepy.\n\nThe food isn't bad, but it's not stellar either. On the English pub side of the menu, I've had a variety of the pasties, which were excellent. In true English tradition, however, the peas were canned, not fresh. The mushroom pie was good, though it's not my favorite. The fish and chips look great -- not greasy -- but I've never had them. On the American side of the menu, the grilled cheese is good but the sloppy joes have an odd flavor. Best to eat English when in a pub.\n\nThere's plenty of seating in the pub, both in the main room and the back room. There are TVs in the main room, generally showing sports, but a combination of light from outside and a terrible screen make watching the big screen unbearable. Sit with your back to it. The main room also has a pool table and video poker, if you feel the urge.\n\nThis place can be hard to miss, so don't pass it too quickly. They share a parking lot with a motel, and the lot is usually marked with strings of flags."
0,"We have a group that meets monthly and have been to George & Dragon II one other time so we felt safe going back, but this time was like day and night. We got there early because we planned on having a dozen or so people there on a Friday evening, and there was a larger party in the back room. The other half of the room was empty so we asked to sit there. The waitress agreed so we took a seat. We asked for drinks which took a few minutes. Two friends came after we got our initial round, and they were ignored. The waitress seemed to be more interested in the larger group with the bigger tip. \n\nPart of our meeting dealt with being online since we're a technology education group, and we were blown off. Finally we were told that they no longer have wireless (which they use to \""share\"" with the hotel next door). This was really annoying, but we weren't offered any excuses or apologies. We put away our laptops and prepared to enjoy an evening of drinks and dinner. \n\nAfter an hour of literally not getting served (drinks or food), we waited for a table to open in the front. A few of our people were annoyed and left without ordering anything and another person was told not to bother coming. We finally got a booth out front and complained to the waitress there. She said the next round was on the manager, who she supposedly told about our unhappiness (but unsurprisingly, he never came over at all to talk to us). We got our free drinks and two of us who were famished were able to eat. \n\nAs soon as we were done eating, we got out of there and parted from the bust of an evening. We quickly removed George and Dragon II from our rotation of places for this meeting. \n\nFrom the fact this is has become a dive bar (absolutely NOTHING like the AWESOME George and Dragon I on Central), that the wait staff mostly sucks, and that they don't seem to care about customers, we are completely done with this place. DO NOT GO HERE."
1,"I would have probably rated this place 3 stars or higher in the past, but the place still smells like smoke, years after the statewide no-smoking in restaurants ban.   Lunch dishes tend to be very small.  One piece of fish on a fish and chips, etc.   The wait staff is friendly and there is plenty of seating."
0,"This place is straight up creepy and run down. Last time I went all the G&D insignia was gone and the menu seriously said, \""Restaurant name to be determined\"" or something equally as ludicrous. Avoid at all costs. The menu is sub-par, the service is crappy, and the decor is about two decades out of date."
0,"NO it's still open for business. I spilled a beer all over myself. stupid me. It was my first beer. I told the waitress. I spilled my beer can you bring another. I waited 10 minutes. She forgot. then she brought the bill with both beers on it. CaN i GET THIS BEER REMOVED? I'll check with my manager she said. An older man came out to my table and yelled\"" hey young man you still a beer on yourself you take care of it next time! I was humiliated. Thank you so much! Food sucked also as bad as the service. Good bye. It should be closed."
0,The rooms are nice but my property was stolen from my room. \n1 Wacom tablet and mouse\n1 button down shirt (yes a shirt!).\n\n  only noticed the shirt missing then when I returned home noticed that my Wacom tablet was missing as I needed to edit some images. I only had one bag for my trip so it was always with me (it's a messenger bag). \n\nWaiting to hear back from the hotel...if it's not what I want to hear then I'll file a policy report. I fault myself for not noticing right away but I've never ever had this happen to me before. Not good times.
1,"Definitely not one of the nicer Hiltons I've stayed at, but close to the airport...so its convenient and the inside of the place is nice enough.  Not the place you want to leave ANY valuables in your car though...the parking lot is dark in a lot of places, spaces can be finicky finding depending how busy they are and it's not in the greatest area of town.\n\nIn fact it was kind of comical...I left the hotel in the evening to grab a bite to eat...and less than a mile down the road was strip club after strip club...if that's any indication of the area.\n\nNext door is a Holiday Inn and honestly I would recommend getting the rates on both and just staying at the cheeper one."
1,"For a two day business trip, I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn. I wish I could say that the friendly service offset the shortcomings on the rooms but I cannot. \n\nThe bulk of my complaints concern the bathroom. From the ever-running industrial fan to the unfortunately positioned door (flush with the bath tub AND toilet) and the tub plunger that does not plunge (or provide a seal for a bath) I was really, really disappointed with the bathroom. If you're like me, and look forward to hotel bathrooms more than anything else, then you'll definitely want to pass on this hotel. \n\nAnother drawback is organization of the rooms in relation to the lobby. There are two major, long wings and my room was at the farthest end of one of those wings. It reminds you of the Shining in that respect...an endless, drab hotel corridor that feels like it'll never stop and when you do arrive it's to a heinous bathroom.\n\nLastly, the food is very generic and barely a step above plane-quality. \n\nOverall, the hotel has generic, but clean, decor; unfortunate layout; poor food; situated in a business park ; and has annoying bathrooms. There are worse hotels in the universe so I'll give this one two stars but I'd be hard pressed to ever find myself returning."
2,"The breakfast is suitable. The pool is adequate. Nothing really wowed me.\n\nOh, one thing that sucked was that they allowed someone else in my party to change information on our reservation when the reservation was on MY card.  AKA WITHOUT my permission. So, that was pretty sweet."
3,"It was decent for the price - it was cheap, but clean and quiet.  Travis at the front desk was quite helpful and understanding of our unique situation."
1,"Disappointed for a Hilton. While room was large and spacious, bathrooms were dated. I can hear every move the people upstairs make since they checked in around 130am and then unpacked for 30 minutes. Air is loud and noisy as well. Just disappointed...."
1,The service in the bar & grill was great. My server Mitch took great care of me... however the food.... I would have been better off with a Carl's Jr $6 burger. The hotel staff in my hotel even told me their burgers were great. Far from the truth. The Black and Blue burger gave me a black eye! ouch... The fries a double smack in the face.
3,"I usually stay at the Hilton Garden Inn on Van Buren, but they were full.  I had never stayed here before but was pleasantly surprised.  The facilities were nicely kept.  I took advantage of the Jacuzzi in the morning along with nice complimentary coffee.  \n\nI was very happy with my room.  It had dinning and sitting area and separate bed room.  I much prefer that.  Most importantly, the manager, Scott Chu, came and helped me out when I had an issue at check in.  Thank you Scott.  I will be back."
2,"I stayed here for 5 nights while on a business trip, and  was really happy.\n\nThe  rooms are a good size, and the ones we got have a desk so I can work easily. I also like that the desk faces the TV, it is small detail, but one that makes my stay more enjoyable.\n\nThe rooms have free wi-fi, a mini fridge, a microwave, and a Kurig machine for coffee. The beds have adjustable firmness, which is nice, and  our rooms had  couches, a coffee table, and a easy chair.\n\nThe rooms were clean, the staff friendly, and their morning breakfast buffet was good. They also have a mini pantry downstairs that sells snacks, and most importantly, redbull.\n\nThey also have a business center, which you can print to from your room, and that has some desk space and computers for guest use.\n\nIt is a great balance between cost and comfort, and exactly what I needed for this trip."
2,"I stayed here for 3 nights and leave tomorrow. It's not a bad hotel but just a little worn. The carpet is old in the halls and my room. Then gym is also very small and not easily accessible - you have to go outside into the pool area to get there. And the pool area is fenced in so you have to reach over the fence to pull a lever to let yourself out. It's actually not that easy to get in/out. \n\nThe gym is in it's own building, a very very small building. Not much room to do much of anything and not well ventilated, which is portmanteau for a gym. \n\nHowever the service is friendly and breakfast was pretty good too. For about 12 bucks you can get an omelet packed with everything you can imagine. Good stuff!!"
2,"Pros:  friendly, helpful staff; clean facilities despite being somewhat dated; easy access to freeway; Waffle House in parking lot.\n\nCons:  something up with the water (too much softener?) -- felt like I could never quite rinse all the soap off; surrounding area not the greatest."
1,Luke warm water; low water pressure; tub needs to be replaced (looks dirty).  Workout facility is mediocre.  This is the worse HGI they I've stayed in.  Checking out to and going to a different hotel.  Staff was nice. Breakfast was good.
1,"Um.... seriously?!?!?!  4 1/2 stars?!?!?!\n\nI guess if you are a blue collar worker that has less than 30 minutes for lunch and you want to eat in a run down neighborhood bar atmosphere and over pay for sub par food than this is the place for you.\n\nMy husband and I just ate there.  He ordered the Chipotle Steak Sandwich, diet style.  That is no bread and a side salad instead.  It looked like something you would get in a mall food court.\n\nThe ONLY vegetarian option was a grilled cheese sandwich.  I got the fruit cup as a side.  It was a bit hard, a bit flavorless... cantaloupe.   I could have made a much better lunch at home for less than the $21 we paid to eat at South Bank Grill.\n\nI can't believe I just ate at this place!!!"
0,closed - this is now la canasta.
0,"Did everything they could to avoid doing the right thing.\n\nS&M were responsible for a managing my corporate relocation package in conjunction with United Van Lines, last year. When our furniture arrived across the country, our brand new $4,000 leather sofa was scratched up, with big baggy indentations and giant grease stain on it.\n\nI immediately demanded a full replacement, since what I had before the move was literally weeks old. They responded that their policy was to \""repair\"" the goods, but to the contrary, they provided a full replacement fee for all the smaller (cheaper) items.\n\nWe agreed to allow a local \""professional\"" leather company do the repair work and they only removed a few of the scratches. The grease stains and the dents were still present and they even added new damages in transportation, including ripping off one of the foot casters! \n\nThe repairs ultimately cost S&M $1,750 and when I told them that it was unsatisfactory work, they claimed they had fulfilled their contractual obligations.\n\nI ended up having a separate hearing (as per the contract, to resolve any disputes) and despite providing both photos and written accounts of the poor service and damages, S&M were somehow deemed to have satisfactorily repaired my sofa.\n\nNow, come to write these reviews and I find that \""Advanced Leather Solutions\"", who performed this terrible work have consistent 1 and 2 stars on Yelp for poor service and even worse customer service.\n\nI am so incredibly frustrated, since in the long run it would have probably been near enough the same cost for them to just replace the sofa, and we would have all been happy. But as I stated, they went so far as to use their legal team's time and resources to fight me to justify this terrible service, which only added to their costs in this process.\n\nWhat a waste of a year!"
0,"I had a terrible moving experience with S & M movers and United. Every load they delivered was crushed or in pieces. My kitchen table was unable to be repaired. For an unknown reason they had disassembled the base of the table and when they delivered it, there were missing pieces and they were unable to assemble it. They wanted to compensate me $48 for a table that was $1000 brand new.  Furthermore, I'm now stuck with trying to get rid of a broken table and the four chairs, which is difficult because I do not have a way to transport it. (Thus, the reason I hired movers to begin with.)  \n\nMy most fragile and valuable item was my road bike.  I very carefully packaged it for the move and it arrived partially disassembled with damage to the gears.  The compensation they offered to fix it was $35...not even close to what it will cost. \n\nI would assume there would be some damage when moving items 2,000 miles across country, but the condition of my furniture and boxes was unacceptable. Try another company and hopefully you'll have better luck!"
0,"This company is by far the worst moving company I have experienced. They are the local agent for United Van Lines so when I called United my move was assigned to  this company.\n\nI moved from across the state from Az to Ca. First off, the day of the move was deferred to two days after a last minute notice. Never mind I thought, this happens. I was flexible. My husband had to take half a day off but it was ok. The movers reached on time and were respectful of our space, but we're not super fast.\n\nTwo weeks later when it was time for the delivery, we were given a four hour window. We has moved into our new apartment so we were ready to settle in ASAP.\n\nOn the day of delivery the movers reached an hour into the delivery window and started unloading. I was excited that at last we will have a house with our stuff in it. The two men were courteous and fast. Them came the trauma - the furniture was not all intact. Somehow they had managed to Brel the coffee table, side table, a desk, a bug dresser ( WTH).\n\nI asked if the movers could take care if the insurance, Ns obviously they denied as there is a laid out process according to which the customer will call the estimator, who is not going to have any sRed available for 10 days. after the estimators visit, it will take at least 15 days for his report to be submitted to the insurance who will in turn take another 15 days to process. There is a chance that the estimator is late in filing the report. So after this back and forth we received our insurance 3 months after the move.\n\nNot my most wonderful moving experience ."
3,"I love this location, but then I live not even a few miles away. I love that they are constantly improving the campus. Even though it can be a bit annoying for a semester, by the time you come back the next semester the crappy dirt lot with a million pot holes has turned into a beautiful parking lot...well, if you can call parking lots beautiful that is!\n\nI have taken 4 semesters here, mostly just one class at a time. But coming from San Diego, where we have Universities and Community colleges coming out our ears, I think South Mountain is top notch!\n\nThe teachers and staff are great. The classes offered are usually very convenient for working people. The campus is beautiful and I hope as it continues to grow and get updated, I will continue to take many classes here."
3,"Cool atmosphere, awesome mix of people and its super close for me."
0,This place is terrible! I live relatively close which made it my number one place to go grab little things during a project. The people working inside are very rude and are very unhelpful.\n\nI bought a shop vac that they had on special but sure enough I get it home and it breaks within 24 hours. I took it back and they wouldn't refund me the money. They only exchanged it for another one. If the first one broke why would I want a second one?\n\nThe biggest kicker of all was when I needed to rent a pump to drain my pool. The process was smooth but about a month after I used and returned the pump I had an unauthorized charge on my credit card. It was something unrelated from Ace but this was the only place that I had used my card within 6 months. I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN! I've had nothing but bad luck!
1,"Came in on a Friday night to have dinner with the family food was ok, nothing to write home about.   Avoid coming to this place on the weekend if you want to have a conversation with your guest. The tacatacas and karaoke dj make it impossible for you to talk and enjoy your food. Its becomes a bar full of  depressed fat girls singing songs that make you want shoot yourself. Also, make sure you check your bill the wait staff tends to over charge. Too pricey for South Phoenix."
2,"This Subway wasn't quite what it could be during my visit today, so let's get the bad out of the way first:\n\n*  Sandwich Maker Girl #1 was snarky.  She needs more training or else a job in a sewing shop!\n\n*  They were out of the cheese I always get on my Subway sandwiches, Pepper Jack!\n\n*  They did have one booth (Yeah booths!), but they had an empty Iced Tea dispenser sitting on it.  I went ahead & sat there, but didn't especially enjoy the company.\n\nThere was good too:\n\n*  Girl #2 was nice, & piled up the goodies on my Sub just right!\n\n*  I really liked their new Chicken Dumpling Soup, as well as my sandwich!\n\n*  Great lunch for the money!\n\nSOOO, the delicious food & excellent value saved this one from a low rating.\n\n6\"" Cold Cut Combo $2!  (December Special.)  Bowl of soup, crackers, $2.\n\nYum!     :-)"
2,"I have eaten here four times since I used to work in the area. The first three times were uneventful and dram free, as any lunch hour should be. \n\nThe Fourth and final time time, however, I ordered a meatball sub. I took one bite (or tried to) of it and the whole this fell apart. It was a mushy mess. I got up to exchange it for a sub I could actually eat. The \""sandwich girl\"" (I should have gotten her name) saw me standing there but waited on two customers before acknowledging me. I showed her my \""mushy mess\"" and she actually asked me what I want to do about it. Oh........those were fighting words, but I kept my cool. I told her I wanted a new sandwich, but NOT a meatball. All she said to me, without even looking up from the cash register was, \""I'll have to charge you .80 more.\"" Oh good grief...whatever. I handed her my credit card. The purchase probably cost Subway more in fees than it was worth. \n\nNote to manager: Train your employees in customer service!"
1,"Let me start off with something positive. The two gentlemen that helped me this past week were very nice. \n\nNow for the bad...\n\nThe past two times I've been to this Subway, they've been out of something. The first time it was tuna and this past week I went in and they were literally out of all the bread! All they had was a few 6 inch pieces of bread left that I could choose from and told me that they had flatbread I could use since I was wanting a foot long. I ended up getting the last two 6\"" pieces they had left which was a white and wheat bread. To make matters even worse, the door had been left wide open to the storage unit that they keep the bread in to keep it fresh so my bread was a little stale. Next, I get to the vegis and the guy tells me that they are out of a lot of the vegetables! How does that happen, Subway! It was around 7 that I went in so it's not like you were running low because you were about to close! And not only that, but the lids that are supposed to be covering all the vegis, meat, ect. to keep them from going bad were all stacked in the middle of the bar in a huge pile! It's safe to say that I'll be going to the Subway on 24th St. and Baseline from now on."
4,"One of the best things about golfing in the Phoenix area is that there are many great high end courses where the general public is welcome. Here in the Boston area, most of the best courses are snooty private clubs.\n\nRaven is one of the best golf courses I have played in Phoenix.  It can be pricey, especially during the peak season in the spring, but the course is beautiful and challenging, and since the desert golf motif is my personal favorite, it ranks high up there for me.  For a little less $$, Legacy and Vistal are nearby, and are also nice courses with great views of South Mountain."
3,"Raven @ South Mountain is great.  Obviously, the most unique thing about this course is the distinct non-Arizona vegetation, which really takes you out of the surroundings.  It's definitely one of the most beautiful courses in the Phoenix area.\n\nIt also has its fair share of interesting holes.  Water is rare, but comes into play a couple of times on the front nine, as well as on the 18th hole.  There are a few greens that are very well protected, so make sure your bunker game is in working order.\n\nThat said, it is quite pricey, with a summer morning round costing over $50.  For $50, there are better courses to play in Phoenix.  Also, it seems a lot of the people who play here think they are hot shots.  Maybe it's because they can afford to spend $50 in the summer on a less-than-perfect course."
3,"I really tried not to like this course. Things didn't start off well with a starter that just didn't have the customer service thing down at all. Nice kid...but very incompetent. He moved our tee time back just because the group behind us wanted to move forward and were regulars. Not bad in and of itself, but he didn't know how to do it without ticking some of the guys off in our foursome. Aside from that, the course was great. As all of the other reviews say...very different for AZ. Condition was immaculate. Fun layout. The group they put me with wanted to play the white tees and it plays VERY easy from the white tees. At the finish of the round I stopped and worked with the course pro who was fitting clubs. He fit me for a driver and actually instead of trying to sell me a driver told me that my current driver is perfect for me. Pace of play was great...but we teed off at 6:40 am and played in just under 4 hours."
1,"The course is in very good shape and is one of my favorites to play.  I like the course so much that I purchased the OB card from the Raven in the fall which offers a substantial discount for play.  My issue is as follows:  Last Saturday, I attempted to book a round for the coming Thursday.  I was informed by a young lady (Courtney?) that as a Raven card holder that I could only book four days in advance.  I got up at 7:00 AM the next morning and called for a tee time on Thursday.   I was asked if I was an OB card holder by Ben.  When I confirmed this, Ben advised me that there were no tee times until after 2:45 PM  on the Thursday.  I explained that I had tried to book the day before and was advised I need to wait until this morning to get a tee time and how could all of their tee times be taken.  Ben advised that members could book seven days in advance hence there were no tee times available.  I mentioned to Ben that it would appear that as an OB (Raven) cardholder that I was being penalized.  Ben advised no as I was getting cheap golf.  I replied that I was being penalized as if you can't get a tee time then you can't get the discounted golf.  Ben acknowledged that there was some truth to this.  I advised that I would be speaking to the course general manager Derek about is.\nLater that same morning I had a friend call the course for a tee time on the Thursday.  He was asked if he had an OB card and he did not.  At that point he was offered several tee times by Courtney.  I then called back at about 8:45 AM and spoke with Courtney.  She did not ask me if I had the discount card.  I asked for tee times on the Thursday morning and was offered several.  I subsequently booked one for Thursday morning.\nI certainly feel that the Raven staff and management is not being honest and forthright with OB cardholders and does not afford them the same courtesy that they provide to full fare golfers.  I will attempt to speak with the general manager today in an attempt to rectify these  disreputable practices.  Should this not work, I will contact the OB Sports Card management about same.\n\nDon't get me wrong; this is one of my favorite courses to play but my play and others will cease if this issue is not addrwssed"
1,"The plan had been to eat at home.  Our friend, staying with us for the holidays, was out.  The two of us wanted to cook - we really did, but staring at the cats was taking up all of our time.  That and we were kinda at different stages of fighting off a cold.  Our friend called from the road - he was headed back to our place - and he was sick.  We said \""Bring home food\"".  He was planning to stop at Walgreen's and there was a brand new Little Caesars next to it (near the address listed for this review, but not yet even officially listed.  Mine was at 19th Avenue and Southern).  I was hesitant to go w/ that one - but I figured hey, it's new.  Places are normally better than usual when they are new, right?  \n\nHe got one cheese and one Peperoni.  Had it just been so many years since eating really really bad pizza that I just forgot what it was like?  Because this was NOT good pizza.  Greasy, sure.  But there was no flavor.  None.  It's like I had to check to see that I really had food in my mouth.  Sure, I could tell what it was supposed to taste like but a) Those were not high standards and b) It never even made it's own low standards.  \n\nYou must be thinking wow - 2 stars?  It sounds worse than that.  Here's my thought\n - I didn't get food poisoning.  Normal \""sick after eating bad greasy pizza\"" feeling still applied, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been.\n - The service was really fast as it is a \""to go\"" place - the pizzas are just waiting for customers to walk in the door\n - I was full after eating it\n - I didn't have to cook."
0,"Little Caesars, Marcos, Numero Uno etc... the fast food of pizza joints. Beware places that have pizzas 'pre-heated, ready to go.'  Quite simply, you get what you pay for. I don't even put Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominoes in the same category as these places, at least their pizzas are cooked to order.\n\nLittle Caesars crust is comparable to cardboard, the ingredients are unrelentingly cheap, and it's incredibly greasy. However the price is unbeatable. For $5 you can get a large pizza, but it's easy to see why."
3,"I know, I know.  It's absolutely forbidden on Yelp to like Little Caesar's Pizza.  Well, sorry about that!  Yes, we all have our \""best pizza place in the whole world\"".  Mine is on Colorado Bv. in Pasadena, CA.  With that said, I LIKE THE PIZZA AT LITTLE CAESAR'S!  I think it's better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Peter Piper, Chuck E. Cheese, The Pizza Buffet and CiCi's, just for examples!\n\nNow my favorite pizza place here in the Valley is BoomBozz, but here's how Little Caesar's works for me:\n\nThis afternoon I got hungry for pizza to go along with a TV show coming on in a few minutes & I didn't have time to drive 24 miles over to Gilbert to get it!  Instead, I whipped down Central to this place & was home biting into my hot, tasty pizza in TEN MINUTES FLAT...  AND IT WAS GOOD!\n\nDetermined to eat half of it & save the rest for later, I did.\n\nWhen \""later\"" came, right after the last slice of the first half, IT WASN'T MY FAULT!  The pizza was THAT GOOD!     :-))\n\nService?  Instant & friendly!\n\nFreshness?  The pizzas here sell as fast as they can make them!\n\nValue?  Amazing!  (Large Pepperoni $5.)\n\nYAY!  YAY!  YAY!"
3,"Love this place. Yeah, the produce rocks, but I go for the bread, the sinfully delicious fresh baked bread - Cinnamon, Cherry, Cranberry Orange, Mandarin Orange, Almond Poppyseed, Blueberry, Marble Loaf, Apple... Their sliced bread rocks too, of course - honey wheat, sourdough, garlic cheese... I didn't care for the Jalapeno Cheddar (not nearly enough cheddar), but otherwise... mmmm! Ask for their Frequent Bread Buyer Card and get a free loaf when it's full. Lots of sweet treats as well - crumb cake, sugar cookies, macaroons, even peanut brittle. Definitely worth checking out."
3,"I love it when I run into \""my people.\""  In this instance, I'm referring to New Yorkers.  The Fruit Barn is a family run estabishments and the owners are from upstate NY (or mid-State - depending where you are coming from).  \n\nThe store is kind of like an expanded fruit stand you might find at the side of the road.   The produce is locally grown and they sell a large selection Arizona-only made products (like Honey, dressings,  and nuts) -- stuff you might find at AJ's.  They also have fresh baked breads - off all flavors and varieties.  \n\nBring cash because they have funny credit card/debit card use charges.\n\nThis is one of those little  local stores that you need to stop in and support!   With Thanksgiving and Holiday celebrations coming up, you have a great excuse to stop in and check them out!!"
3,"Had one of the best tuna sandwiches here!  I have been wanting to check out so I popped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised at the prices and fair variety of locally grown produce as well as bakery goods, jams, and other goodies.  The debit card dollar charge didn't make me happy but the sandwich gave me temporary amnesia lol I will definitely be back with cash!:o)"
0,"Poor horrible quality! Half of the things are at the end of their shelf life and some are even beyond that- basically some of the things are already gone bad that they are selling. Good luck returning things as the old lady will go psycho on you and start screaming...haha what a joke! I feel pity for them and anyone who might get an experience like I did when i tried to return honey that they sold me which was already bad, probably due to poor temperature control they have in their shop. \nIn summers they rely on air coolers and you can imagine AZ 110 degree days. You would feel like you just walked in a oven....\nThe old lady (owner) is rude and has no etiquettes of how to deal with a customer....I would recommend never walk into that shop or learn from your own bad experience. I wasted my time, money and had bad experience that is going to stick with me for quite some time. Feel bad for other single owners as she is representing them in the worst possible way. For the first time I realized some of the good things that big chains offer. Sorry for being so verbose...but she made us and my wife real upset!"
4,"Summers in Phoenix... So great, all year around!\n\nI come to Phoenix a couple times a year on business, and one of a handful of things I do, without fail, is come to Summers Fruit Barn. If I'm having a rough week, just going there is relaxing to me. It is, essentially, an old, classic roadside attraction that offers some amazing stuff.\n\nThe place has been there as long as I can remember, way back when Baseline Road was quite rural, and now that the area is growing up all around it, I really hope Summers stays. My trips to the area would be incomplete without a stop by to pick up some goodies.\n\nGreat people, simple style, excellent seasonal collection. Cash is best, but not required.\n\nI saw \""K. D.'s\"" review, said he returned honey. But over on Google, Kabir Duggal (same person) griped about returning bread. Methinks Kabir has a personal problem with Summers, I'd take that review with a grain of salt."
1,I'm so surprised by the high reviews of this place.  I live very close by and have been twice.  Both times I was less than impressed.  I was super excited when we moved it to have such a cool thing - a roadside fruit barn near by.  Both times I went the service was HORRIBLY slow.  The place felt hot and there were flies everywhere.  I found the quality of the product to be bad as well.
2,"Being born and raised in South Phoenix among the other fruit and flower stands it is real nice to see at least one survivor. Summers does offer a great variety of products that are unique and some of which you will not find in your local Fry's or Safeway. The thing I did find odd is that they resold Kirkland raisin bread with a Alpine breads sticker over the Kirkland logo. The only thing that really bothered me was the lack of patience and respect Mrs. Summers had for the two young men working there at the time I was there. Since I am sure she will read this and may ever post a rebuttal I would like to say you have a charming produce stand, delicious fresh squeezed orange juice and I hope you stay in business for many many years to come as your business is one of the last displays of South Phoenix original culture. The only reason I did not rate you higher is because when you made your lack of respect for your employees blatantly apparent in front of me it made me not want to support your business. As someone with a Bachelors of Science in Business and Minors in Management and Small Business Development, you are only as good as your employees and your employees will only be as good as you treat them. I wish Summer's Fruit Barn the best of luck!"
3,"Although I live nowhere near Summers, I happened to notice their produce stand on the way to an event at the Humane Society, so I stopped on my way home.  Lots of produce, of course, and a good selection of pickled and canned items as well.\n\nI found the staff to be so friendly, offering samples of a few different fruits and even going to the trouble to point out that they had less expensive lemons than the locally grown variety I was purchasing.  Both varieties of dates I purchased were excellent, although, why do they have to look like big 'ole cockroaches?  Can't someone engineer a more attractive fruit?\n\nAnyhow, definitely worth a stop if you live in the neighborhood.  Keep in mind their prices are for cash payment.  Using a card will cost you more, but I'm not sure how much."
0,Let me preface this with explaining that I rarely write negative reviews but this place definitely deserves one. The sales girl sold me a hair pony attachment that did not match my hair. She insisted it worked. When I got home and looked at my hair with the piece in good light it did not even come close! I even took it to my hair dresser and she could not believe she said it worked. When I went to bring it back they insisted that I wore it when all I did was take it out of the pouch and net. I told them that they should take another out of the package to see how it looks when it comes out of the package they refused and just kept insisting that I wore it . Obviously this store is only about  making a buck -the customer service is awful and  salesgirls have no\nKnowledge !
0,"Very Very Very Bad Service! These guys cannot be trusted. My husband and I bought the tire repair/replacement warranty certificates per tire about a year ago as discount tire recommends. I had a staple in my tire yesterday that created a flat so we went in to have it repaired. The service man said it was not repairable and then proceeded to sell us 2 more tires at a small fee of $500 because of our AWD. He seemed to change his story slightly during our conversation with him so we decided to investigate further if his statements were accurately and WAS our tire really not repairable? First, we found that the tires he was trying to sell us were about 50 bucks cheaper per tire AND we our tire was indeed repairable. Oh I should also mention Mr. discount tire failed to give us back our flat tire and wheel when we returned to pick up our car (after we told him to leave the donut as is). We called the next morning to pick up our tire and wheel and he claimed he threw away the tire but we told him that was not his to throw away and he better find it. Anyway - we got it and took it to another tire company who was able to repair it in 10 minutes, showed me the tire and all the details about it. I can't believe that Discount Tire tried to pull this on us. Well they pulled it on the wrong people and we will not stop here. Other websites and BBB will hear about this. \n\nTry just being honest, good service representatives next time Discount Tire!"
0,"Where do I start with this?  I am used to the Discount Tire that makes sure their customer is taken care of.  I had a tire blowout on the freeway on a Sunday afternoon.  I towed my car to this shop as it happened to be the nearest one to where my car broke down at.  Being a customer, I knew 2 things.  1, my tire was flat and 2, Discount tire would fix it.  I left my car in their parking lot overnight and called them first thing Monday morning to advise them of the situation.  They said that they would get everything taken care of, that they would be fine only having to replace the one tire, and it would be done that same day.\n\nSo I picked up my car that afternoon, happy as a clam.  One of the employees (Victor?) seemed to be in a rush and while my credit card was giving me problems, he was pressuring me to just use a different form of payment and call my credit card company later.  That wasn't very nice.  Regardless, I was happy to be over the situation and I drove my car home.  \n\nThe next day (today), I got ready for work.  On my way out of the Starbucks parking lot, I notice the same exact wheel that they fixed was yet again, flat.  It had barely enough air in it for me to lug it to the nearest QT and fill it with air.  I then proceeded to the nearest discount tire to that location (4th ave and Bell).  It was then revealed to me that the tire that and the blow out, the same tire that was then again flat, was flat and was having tire issues due to a CRACKED RIM.  \n\nNow.. I am not saying my rims were in perfect condition.  In fact, I knew that they had seen better days.  But words cannot convey how it felt to know that they did not fully inspect my rim as they should have for safety/hazard reasons.  \n\nIf they had only taken an additional 3 minutes.. THREE minutes... to check the rim and see that it was cracked, I would have GLADLY paid for a new set of rims and tires right then and there.  Times like that it is not about money- it is about safety and I TRUSTED them to tell me that my car was or wasnt safe to drive.  They were NEGLIGENT in not checking for my safety and literally, put my life at risk.\n\nI can't imagine what could have happened if I didn't notice the flat this morning and kept driving up the freeway to work.  Another blowout during rush hour?  \n\nThis discount tire put my life at risk and it is my mission to make sure that this gets as far as it can.  This can happen to ANYONE.  I am lucky that I caught it before it was too late.\n\n\nI would not recommend this discount tire to my worst enemy."
0,"I actually did a lot of research before picking this place. Having one bad experience was enough to learn my lesson and not let the hospital coordinator choose the assisted living facility. I was about to learn another huge lesson: high ratings on a website means nothing.\n \nLife Care Center smells like urine as soon as you walk in and you better know where you're going and have a room number because you can't ever find someone that works there. This place is more rest home than rehab...what am I saying, this is a nursing home. The rehab this facility offers is a joke. They wheel out their patients into the hallway and they sit there ALL DAY never getting changed and reeking of urine. It's a pretty sad scene, I cried the first time I came to visit my loved one here and started working immediately to get them out of that horrible place. After a few days of fighting with the insurance company, they won and we had to settle in that crap hole for 4 months.  With only our sense of humor to fall back on we started calling it skid row for seniors.  \n\nThe food was horrible.  The rehab was nonexistent.  I had a really bad experience in a meeting with the director, head nurse and physical therapist but it gave me a better understanding of why this facility is so mismanaged.  The nurses try to put everyone in these \""protection pants\"", the best way I can describe them is as a cushioned chastity belt.  Apparently they are supposed to protect you from injuring yourself when you fall but I believe they use them because they keep the urine from leaking everywhere.  We declined signing the consent to wear the pants and the orderly whispered \""good, these poor people are too dim witted to know what they are signing\""."
0,"Please do not allow your hospital coordinator to send your family member to this place. It is NOT a rehab center - it is a retirement facility with slow to respond staff members. My mother had heart failure. As a result she loss some oxygen and blood flow to her brain. It effected her memory somewhat and caused her to be very weak and she becomes exhausted doing simple task. She stayed in the hosputal a lil under 2 weeks simply trying to BREATH. She was assigned here. I wish I knew enough to have her sent to another facility to regain her skills.\n\nThe speech therapist had no ideal what cognitive exercises we could use with my mother outside of the few she herself did. When I told her of several memory exercises her hospital therapist suggested we work during our family interaction with my mom, this therapist seemed surprised and said she would think about something we could do. I wanted to ask her if she graduated or is simply fulfilling hours for a requirement. My guess is the latter. \n\nI saw the physical therapist come in and do 3 simple arm exercises with her. Not one time did I hear him ask her to do any on her own. He also did not give her exercises she could complete on her own to improve any of her motor skills.\n\nThe nursing staff I saw the Friday I visited were less than professional. NO ONE wore gloves nor did I see anyone utilize hand sanitizer between patients, before or after patient interaction. This was especially disconcerting because my mom got pneumonia since her arrival and can to risk more germs. When I mentioned to several aides to wear gloves they appeared pissed or rolled their eyes but did comply. I found myself Clorex wipes on everything in the room.\n\nI can say that as i spent the 2 weekend overnights with my mom in an uncomfortable chair, I saw 2 or 3 CNA'S and 1 nurse who were caring, compassionate and professional. This is definitely not the norm. Slow call button response had me moving my mother to the restroom myself. Loud employees repeatedly outside the door had me closing it and suffering thru the stuffiness in the hot room. And I'm not sure why the staff chose to talk louder and louder during their interactions with my mom when she kept trying to tell them her various concerns with her I'll fitting oxygen mask. \n\nI have to leave and return to California today but am hesitant to do so. I am worried that her care is not in the best of hands and wonder what would happen had I not been by her side. Her sisters will continue to be vigilant until I return but in the interm, we are looking to move her asap."
3,"This place is the real deal. \n\nI know it's a horrible cliche` but when you enter an ethnic cuisine resturant and hear the customers AND the wait staff speaking the language of the cuisine ... you KNOW it's gonna be good!! \n\nI've been going to El Mesquite for nearly 10 years. The servers have been there forever and I think are related to one another. \n\nWhen you first enter you see some sterotypical posters on brightly painted walls and cutsey mexican pottery and plants. The resturant used to be only one room and has since expanded to two rooms. Another sign that a place is good! :) You are expected to seat yourself and will wait a minute or two before a bowl of paprika dusted toritilla chips that are served with TOXIC hot sauce!! Man it's killer!! but sooo good!! Just sprinkle some salt on it and ask for water and power through it!! Trust me! It'll get sweet after a bowl or two!! and when it does... MAN! that's good eatin!!\n\nI like the two eggs with beans and tortillas with a side order of fried potatos! it's the best vegetarian breakfast on the south side! For lunch, a yummy burrito will do! And for dinner, the combination dinners are KING! The beans a lil runny, but when mixed with the rice, are AMAZING!! I like their iced tea, it's very dark, almost like sun tea. and the cups are huge! \n\nAnd every meal is under $10! who can beat that?? Look out for the daily specials! they're rarely on the menu and are usually indulgences of a cook that gets bored easily! LOL! Today's was Pezole with fresh Pan. \n\nOne of the things that can be a little confusing is that the servers rarely give you a check. It's up to the diner to go to the back cashier register and pay. Usually, that's when the diner is told what the total is. I belive this is done as to not rush the patrons out of the resturant, which is something I appreciate. \n\nWhen you're on the south side and want something a little off the beaten path and like leiserly meals served rocket fast and with love super hot suce all for under 10 bucks a pop this is TOTALLY the place for you!! Seat yourself, order water and sweat while u dare to enjoy the salsa! It'll only take a second as your food will be ready in a flash!"
2,"Not wanting to drive all the way to Dick's for Sunday breakfast I decided to Yelp places close to my house I came upon El Mesquite, and decided to give it a try. It is located in a strip mall and I would have never heard of it if it wasn't for Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the staff. As soon as I walked in I knew it was going to be good because the place was packed. I found the only table available and took a gander at the menu. The chips were crisp and the spicy salsa was delicious. I ordered a quesadilla and the steak ranchero. the steak was cooked in peppers and onions and came with a mildly spicy sauce. My meal was pretty delicious and so was the $3.25 Negro Modello. I looked around at the entrees that sat in from of the people around me and everything looked good and the portions were huge. The food overall was a little greasy, but it was definitely some home cooked mexican (which I could eat every day of my life). I'll have to keep this one on the radar for cheap and good south side fare."
2,Decent food but was totally dead inside at 6pm on a Thursday.  Cant really think of anything they offer that I cant get elsewhere in South Phoenix.  Had some chips and salsa and a green chile pork burrito.  Good homemade flavor to it.
3,Yum!  Cute little restaurant with yummy food.  Waitress doesn't really speak English but that was so unimportant.  The service was good and the food was really good.\n\nGreat free chips and salsa.  My kids liked the cheese enchilada so much that I didn't even get a bite!  Great bean and cheese burrito.  The best chili relleno I have had in a long time.\n\nThe price was a tiny bit more than I was expecting but I will be back!
3,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review of El Mesquite. It's one of those neighborhood standbys that you love having around. We've eaten takeout several times and been thrilled with the carne asada, carnitas, and more. And while we've tried it several times already, I'll add that it could easily have been twice as many or more. But their hours are a frequent source of frustration. How does a restaurant surrounded by a mostly residential area close every night at 7:00 and have otherwise seemingly arbitrary hours? Given that it's family-owned, I give them a pass and will return again. Just make sure you call ahead if coming from a distance."
3,"The food is hot and good. If I was just rating the food I would give it five stars. But the service was slow and unresponsive. In fact the girl bussing helped us more  than our waitress. They adjusted our meal without complaint as I have food allergies. Portion size is perfect, you leave full but not busting. I would recommend this place for great Mexican food."
2,"Wow, it's been about 3 1/2 years getting back around to this one, but I stopped in here for lunch today and was a little less impressed than last time, maybe only because I've had time to try so many Valley Mexican restaurants since.\n\nLet's get the NEGATIVES out of the way first:\n\n*  The Men's Room is one person at a time, yet there was no lock on the door!\n\n*  The price for my #5 Combination choice was high at $9.75, particularly given the modest serving sizes of the chips, the smallish chile and the taco.  (Photo.)\n\n*  The booth seat was too low for the height of the table.\n\n= = = = = =\n\nThe POSITIVE things:\n\n*  The seasoned chips were good and the thick, pureed, spicy salsa was just right!\n\n*  My combo platter of a (Pablano) Chile Relleno, Shredded Beef Taco, Refried Beans, Spanish Rice and a bit of salad was all tasty and everything was served at the right temperature on a hot platter.\n\nIt's 3 Stars this time for busy little El Mesquite, where they are open for Breakfast, have a full bar, and are closed on Tuesdays.     :-)"
0,I would give no stars if it let me. Absolutely horrible service. Food took so long we ended up having to get it to go.
0,Service is waaaaay to slow and there is no drink refills. I dont think I will be coming back
1,Service was terrible and staff was very unfriendly!
4,All the food is great. Best Mexican food. Everything is freshly made. Guacamole and chorizo are the best. People are very friendly too.
1,"= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =\n\n\nThis Chinese cafe & buffet is situated in a Safeway shopping center, & seats about 50.  You can order a combo meal from the picture menu, or fill a styrofoam container to go, from the buffet tables, or eat the buffet here, on a styrofoam plate with plastic tableware.  The dining room is really blah, & the host was jumpy & unfriendly.  There's no soup or salad, but there were a few fruit items available among the 30 food choices.  Some of the hot food was greasy, most of the meat was chicken only, & $6 including a soft drink is high compared to the local competition.\n\nAll in all, even the infamous King Wah a mile west down the street is better, in my opinion.  New China here barely ekes out 2-Stars.\n\nBuffet Lunch $6.00, served 10:30 AM to 3 PM, 7 days."
0,"The lunch buffet is $6.50, but it is awful.  Horrendous Chinese food. I will not be returning."
2,Not much to choose from but you only pay 7$ including drink. Noodles are the best dish. Eveything else is ok. Its good for a work time lunch
2,"clean store, good parking - decent prices too with the gas points savings is a nice bonus."
0,"The worst!  I've had three bad experiences.  To make a long rant longer...\nI went to the store a few weeks ago and they wouldn't give me any cash back.  The cashier said they didn't have enough cash after standing in line what seemed like forever.  Ok, i can deal with it, its a grocery store not a bank.\n\nA few weeks later I went and again stood in line for a lifetime.  The cashier was nice but the food cost was too much for what i got.  I saw later that day the same item for $3 cheaper.  Ok, my fault for not bargain shopping.\n\nThe last straw was a day ago.  I went to pick up a few quick items.  I wanted smoked salmon but I felt that the refrigerator the package was in was too warm.  I looked at the dial on the wall and it read over 55 degrees.  I honestly don't know if that's too warm but for me I didn't want to risk the food poisoning. That fish could kill me!  Okay I'm extreme it would have made me sicker than a homeless dog but I'm strong enough to survive.  I just don't want to have to survive my dinner.\n\nNext I stood in line again for ever and the cashier asked for my Safeway card.  I forgot it and my phone number didn't work.  I asked the cashier if I could use hers.  She looked at me if I asked if I could borrow her house and husband for the weekend. Our conversation went like this:\n\nMe:  \""My phone number inset working.  My I use your (the stores) card please?\""\n\nCashier: \""NO!\""  \n\nMe:  \""Geeze, I said please.  Can your manager enter a store number for me please?\""\n\nCashier:  \""NO!\""\n\nMe: to the lady behind me...\""My I use your Safeway card?\""\n\nCashier:  Started yelling at the woman behind me in Spanish not to give her card to me.  She shouldn't assume I didn't know what she was saying.\n\nMe:  \""Can you call your manager please?\""\n\nCashier:  \""I could get fired for giving you my personal information.  I just can't steal points from Safeway.  I don't think you understand I could loose me job and its too bad you feel this way about it.\""\n\nI'm sorry if her day was bad but all i wanted to do was get $2 off the high priced items and eat.\n\nMe:  \""I'm sorry you have to go to work and feel like your going to get fired for helping customers.  Shame on your manager for not giving you the tools to do your job and making you afraid to assist me.\""\n\nFinally, the woman behind me shared her card as she was shaking her head at the cashier.  I will never shop there again. I also have a $600 per week budget in grocery's for my office.  I will no longer recommend that staff person to shop at a Safeway, regardless of its location."
1,"Clean store. But agree the staff is terrified to actually help you. Not worth the extra money they charge compared to Fry's. Parking is OK. But usually crowded. Wait times in line are ridiculously long. Quit scaring your employees to where they can actually help your customers! Hire more cashiers on days you know it will be busy! Ugh,"
2,"Good product selection.  They didn't have the brand of hair that I use for braiding, hence 3 stars."
4,"YES! YES! YES! Finally! I spy an African American beauty supply store! I walked in and said, \""YES! I found you at last! I need my supplies. There are no beauty supply stores in Northern Arizona and beyond. You have no idea how deprived this Native American girl is!\""\n\nPicked up my black soaps, lightening cream, sponges, hair do wrap, and pumice stone. Yay! I am happy now."
3,"I heard that is was obligatory to do horseback riding while in Phoenix and this place got recognition from one of the travel books I looked at and also from Yelp.  My girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot and we were not disappointed.  Our guide was great and even took our camera and took pictures of us together on our horses.  The scenery in the park was great too.  Great staff, great horses, great scenery, and good prices."
3,"Were originally from Phoenix, but only recently visited Ponderosa Stables for the first time. My Boyfriend and Step Daughter and I went on a 1 Hour Trail Ride, and at $39.00 Per person, I'd say it was worth the smiles it brought her. The horses are reeeeealy slow, so it's a little tougher to enjoy as an adult, but My 12 Yr Old Loved it. The trail guide was great and the trail itself was enjoyable. I hear they have great dinner rides, which we may go check out sometime were in town visiting again."
3,"This was fun.  Originally we wanted to do the T-bone Steak ride but the cowboy on hand took one look at these city slickers and gracefully convinced us to do the shorter trail rides instead.  I am so glad he did.\n\nPrices were great, staff was great.  Overall a fun time."
4,"This place is amazing! The trail ride was absolutely beautiful! My partner and I took a two hour ride. I cannot describe the wonderful beauty of the trail and surrounding nature. There was an awesome view of the city from afar as well! I cannot remember the name of our guide/wrangler, but he is the only Cuban wrangler there. He was SO GREAT! He checked in with us frequently to make sure we were comfortable. I'm really short and my stirrups were hard to reach. He was sweet enough to notice and adjust them for me. The horses were well behaved and I never once felt like I was in danger. This visit was part of my first trip to Phoenix and I would recommend it to anyone! They even have a step structure to help get you on and off the horse. Being so small, I was very grateful for that! All in all, I loved this place and will definitely be back the next time I'm in town!"
3,"The reality of dying was thrust upon Boyce Luther Gulley in his prime. Choosing not to live a life of quiet desperation awaiting the end, he ran away from home, family and friends. Those were sad but wondrous times of soul searching and physical activity. In his heart was permanently etched the vision of those precious moment in time when he and his little girl, Mary Lou, built sand castles on the beach in Seattle, Washington. How she would cry when the tide washed them away. \""Please, Daddy, build me a big and strong castle someday that I can live in. Maybe you ought to build it on the desert where there is no water.\"" He would smile and wonder perhaps it's no coincidence that he migrated to Arizona, where he gradually regained his health. So he built her a native stone castle: 18 rooms, 13 fireplaces, parapets and many charming nooks and crannies, then furnished it with southwestern antiques.\n\nThe \""king\"" died in 1945, before he could send for his family. The little girl now an aged \""princess\"", dwells in her \""sand\"" castle, and is living the last fairytale. By conducting tours, Mary Lou Gulley maintains the castle and perpetuates her dream."
4,Fascinating Place!  The love story that this castle centers around is pure Shakespearian Tragedy.  It will make you cry.  On the flip side this is a pretty ingenious use of waste materials cast aside and re-purposed.  Environmentally friendly all the way back to 1930's.  The price of admission $5 can't be beat.  Definitely worth the trip!
3,"A really neat trinket of a place in the middle of nowhere. I won't try to explain this enigma, I will just say that you will find SOMETHING here that you think is cool. Some parts will pique your interest and others will bore you, but this is a great place if you're looking for something different to do. Check it out!"
2,"Mandatory $10 cash only fee!!! \nYou must pay first, otherwise you can't walk through the house, regardless if you want the tour or not.  Mary Lou Gulley's house is large and eclectic with random objects being used in the architecture; anywhere from recycled bottles, car parts to real petroglyphs.  It is definitely something to see in Phoenix cause it is such a unique home. Note of caution: there a very bumpy rock path to get to the house.  Yet, my lil car was able to make it fine, by driving at a snails pace.  \nOverall it was a cool home to see, but not amazing."
1,Took my parents who were visiting from out of state. Over priced for what you get. Tour was disorganized. 1st tour guide had little knowledge of the history of the astle
3,"Mystery Castle is pretty dang weird.  You get a lot of the vibe just by looking online, but it's definitely interesting to see in person.  The guy who built it used a lot of cheap, recycled items.  I was most fascinated by the burned bricks, they were super cool!  The two guys working were so incredibly nice and enthusiastic during the tour.  It's cash only, and I thought it was worth the price.\n\nHowever, it really seemed like the creator was a d-bag.  When you read the synopsis, he built a real castle for his daughter - who he had abandoned 15 years before.  Sure, it sounds like he had some redeeming moments when he contacted his wife and kid that he had left without a word and passed on his money to them after he finally kicked it, but the guy had an elaborate bar with a \""wishing well\"" (which was pretty clever) so people could order their drinks downstairs and have them brought upstairs, because he hosted a lot of parties.  Just, you know, without his wife and kid.\n\nIt would have been nice to go on the tour when Mary Lou was still around, because she's the one I actually find interesting in the family.\n\nCool experience, but the thing my husband & I talked about most afterwards was the dad who left his daughter when she was 4 years old and thought about her from afar."
2,Bumpy road on the way in! This was a really interesting thing to check out.  My son had a report to do for school so we made the trek!  What an interesting homage for a father to make to his daughter.  I thought it was a bit pricey and wonder what the money is used for as there were plenty of people on the tour.  \nOur tour guides (Juankarlo and Manuel) were REALLY knowledgeable.  I'd recommend a trip to this place if you had nothing else to do and were looking for a curious Phoenix landmark and had money burning a hole in your pocket.  Both Mary Lou and Boyce were quite the eccentrics...
4,I have to say this is the most interesting thing i saw in the entire state. Really cool burned brick artwork and Upcycle architecture. I want to build my own castle now.. totally worth the $10 if your looking for a tourist attraction to liven up a road trip...
0,"He make me a Crown that I don't Need it! Screwed my teeth! The Insurance says that Is not enough proof for do a Crown I said I will not paid for something that the Insurance said is was right! Finally now I found a very good dentist he is trying to fix it but I need to replace it because I was allergic to metal, things that Dr Payne never ask before. Now I have to paid extra 1300$ because a New crown and Insurance not cover crown if is less that 5 years, and maybe I need a Root Canal too so extra money too! Thanks Dr. Payne I want to send you the bill"
1,"My experience at Baseline Dental Care was a mixed bag.  In short, I found Dr. Payne lacking in bedside manner and some of the staff were helpful and some were snippy.  I had problems getting my prostetic fitted and both the dentist and some of the staff seemed impatient with me and I had some communication problems with them.  Some of the staff were quite nice though.\n\nI am used to better care and better communication from a dentist and their staff, so I may be spoiled but I can safely say, I have had better!\n\n***LONG VERSION OF STORY***\n\nI chose Baseline Dental Care because they are a part of Dental Works and my old dentist was a part of that group. Sadly the the root of my tooth was broken and infected which meant it had to be pulled.  The way this was handled upset me.  I was in the chair when Dr. Payne came in.  I had never met him before.  The first words he said were \""I saw your xrays\"" and he sounded upset which was scary for me.  \n\nWhen I got the news, then I worked with the front office to do the cost information.  It was right before Christmas and I was in pain. Unfortunately, the tooth could not be pulled right away or I would have to go without my prostetic (henceforth called a flipper) and would have to go to work toothless.  Plus I had been searching for a new job and going toothless to interviews and Christmas festivities did not appeal.\n\nI was told that the antibiotics might help with the pain or they might not.  Dr Payne told me that the pain could be unpredicable and I might be in as much pain as I was right at that moment for the whole two weeks.\n\nThen I had made my choices and I was going to pay for the flipper ($700) and try to make it through the holiday as best I could.  I tried to ask the assistant whether I could pay by check or bankcard  but she didn't know.  She went away and I had to wait and wait for someone to come back. I needed to get back to work so I went up front, but the receptionist was busy.  So I went back and suddenly, overwhelmed by the expense and the pain, I started crying.  The front lady finally came back and she was very nice and soothing at that point.\n\nWe talked about the plans and I was told that I would pick up the flipper before I got the tooth pulled and maybe the oral surgeon could fit it in.  If it didn't fit, I would come to the dental office right after the tooth pulling and get it fixed.\n\n(Luckily the antibiotic did help with the pain and I had a nice Christmas.)\n\nI set the tooth pulling for the afternoon Jan 3 the soonest I could, but then I had to re-schedule it one more week after due to work conflicts.  The flipper was supposed to be in that week, but Dr. Payne's office never called me about it. I called them and spoke to them Friday the 4th to make sure it was there, and at that time I let them know I was getting my tooth pulled on the afternoon of Jan 8. We arranged when I could pick up the flipper, on Monday.\n\nOn Monday I came on my lunch hour and picked up the flipper and spoke *again* to a staff member and let them know I was getting my tooth pulled the following afternoon and would come in AFTER the tooth was pulled to fit the flipper if needed.  They said okay.\n\nThen Tuesday I got my tooth pulled.  However, the flipper didn't fit into my mouth so my friend was driving me to get it fitted.  I called them on the way to let them know.  I knew their office closed at 4 p.m. and it was 3 so I wanted to give them a heads up (be polite).\n\nThe staff who answered the phone informed me the dentist wasn't there.  I was very upset and she was very snippy with me and told me I had to come in at 10:30 the next a.m. (which would cost me money as I wouldn't be able to work until after.)\n\nSo upset, I called my old dentist office and begged them to fit the flipper and told them I would pay them money to do it.  They refused but they were pretty mad at Baseline too and called them.  They suggested I go into Baseline the next day to get it fitted and that Baseline would give me a partial refund for my trouble.\n\nI went the next day to Baseline and they did not offer me a refund.  The flipper DID NOT FIT, so they did make me a temporary temporary flipper and sent it back to get fitted, so I figured they were having extra expense so I didn't press the matter.  However, the remaining times I dealt with them the dentist ranged from overly familar (hitting me on the arm and calling me \""woman\"") to very unpleasant (lecturing me on how the flipper was the \""cheapest choice\"" so that's why I couldn't eat with it).  I found him difficult to work with and I do not think he and I are compatible as patient and dentist.\n\nOne dentist assistant who was pleasant and gentle with me was Michelle.  I liked her a lot.\n\nI think the communication and the bedside manner of the staff and dentist could be much improved.  I am going to get an implant for my tooth and if I need a temporary cap or need the flipper to be modified during that process, I intend to go to another dentist."
1,"I went to Baseline Dental for cleaning and the annual x-rays. The last time I went there was in summer of 2012. I have no issues with the Dr. Payne and the Hygienists, but I definitely have an issue with their communication on charges for something as simple as a filling. \n\nIn summer of 2012 I was told that I needed 2 fillings and that I would only have to pay $48 out of pocket, while my Insurance will cover the rest of it. The amount they quoted seemed reasonable (I also double-checked with a Dentist friend of mine who runs her own practice in NY). I get the work done, and a month later the real drill begins!\n\nI started getting letters from their collections department saying I owed them another $218. This is after I had already paid them $48 that they told me I owed when I got the treatment done. I paid that amount the day of my treatment and thought I was done! Magically, a month later, they realized they needed to charge me more! I called my Insurance company and was told that the Dentist is charging more than the normal amounts, and that the Insurance will only cover what's reasonable! \n\nMy issue is that a) Baseline Dental needs to charge competitive rates, charges that Insurance company won't refuse to pay, and b) If they get turned down by the Insurance company, stop harassing the patient who actually paid the amount they were asked to at the time of the treatment! \n\nOf course, I called numerous times in Fall of 2012 to get this charge off, wasted hours as I got transferred from one department to another. Baseline Dental wants to rip off their patients so bad (either thru the Insurance or directly harassing the patient), that last year they filed collection on my account for the $218. Luckily, my credit history is really good, and this hasn't impacted me much. However, I am severely disappointed at the greed a business can have, and how this greed and their practice of over-charging has turned a regular patient away! \n\nNote: I still live within a mile of this business, but refuse to go back there as a result of their unprofessional behavior. I will be going there one more time in person to sort things out, but after over a year and half of this battle, I wanted to share this with yelp and get the word out!"

0,"There were such mixed reviews that I had to find out for myself. I've been looking for a new neighborhood pizza joint and hoped that maybe this place could be it. no No NOOOO WAYYYYYY!!!\nFirst: I ordered hot wings, all drummies and extra crispy. The rep said that I couldnt have my requested order because the wings come \""pre-made\"", in \""oven-ready containers\"". When someone orders wings, they take it out of the fridge and place the container in the oven to heat it up. Therefore, unable to take special requests.\nThe pizza arrived piping hot but I had asked for well done with the cheese brown and bubbly. The cheese was melted. I have to agree with the other reviews, there was an odd taste to the sauce and cheese. I'm from Wisconsin so I can taste real, quality cheese. This was very odd tasting \""cheese\"". \nThe wings were absolutely disgusting. Barely warm. I put them under the broiler after they were delivered and they still tasted rubbery. The skin was drenched in sauce but unable to get crispy, even after my broiler attempt. Very fatty.\nOn a positive  note, the delivery was quick. I wish they would have taken the extra time to at least make an effort to make the customer happy. Honestly, (and my own personal opinion because I'm no expert) I dont think the wings were even at health dept standards. \nThis was the worst $30 I've ever spent. I encourage people to do more research before settling on Gino's. I'll never order from here again."
3,"I complained recently that there were no local takeout pizza places nearby, to which several friends responded that I was nuts. \""Have you tried Gino's?!?!\"" they asked..... I promised that I would get there ASAP and finally did so tonight. I had my in-laws over and we all agreed that it was generally very good. I don't know that I'm a fan of the crust, but there's not much of it and I am a fan of that. Plus, I was impressed to find tasty fresh red onions on our veggie pizza (weird that this simple ingredient is remarkable, but it was), and overall good toppings with slightly above average sauce. I vow to immediately stop ordering from the chain place around the corner unless I'm really desperate -- all future business goes to Gino's when I'm in the neighborhood and looking for takeout. And there's also a decent little area for dining in, including arcade, but who knows when we'll ever make the time to stay. Maybe if there's ever a band on the stage?"
0,"This is my second trip to Gino's. First trip was absolutely fantastic. Ordered my pie, stopped over, picked it up, and had a great conversation with the dude working the counter.\n\nSecond trip?\n\nOrdered online.  Made a stop at Walgreens being that I was told by the site that it would be 25 minutes.  Stopped in, no pizza ready.  Instead, I was told they didn't make it because I didn't answer the call they made to me.  I checked my phone right there, no missed calls.  I was all \""Alright, dude, no worries, cook me up a quick pepperoni, canadian bacon, and green olives\"" which he was happy to do.  Told me it would be 10 - 15 minutes.  25 - 35 minutes later, pizza is done.  Get it home, no canadian bacon.  I even tipped those assholes thinking I screwed something up.\n\nGo somewhere better.  While waiting, I saw them opening giant cans of pre-made pizza sauce.  They may have been around for 40 years, but buying store-bought pizza sauce for over priced pizza doesn't make much sense.\n\nOh, and chop your olives up, you lazy twats.  Like on the first pizza I had from you."
1,This Sonic Drive-In is ok.  I think it is more the idea of what drive-ins used to be why one goes to a Sonic. I have only heard and seen what a drive-in used to be like on documentaries and some movies. \n\nThe food here is what it is for what you pay for it. You do not go here expecting anything great  tasting as you just will not get it. After all this is fast food. The carhops do not use skates. Saving this location from a lower score is the friendly service received.
2,Car hop was nice (in that fake nice sort of way). It did take them a while to answer the button and they weren't even busy. We went after I had to visit the urgent care across the street. At least 2 songs played before we got to order. The one on 48th st and baseline is way better
1,Slow service. I've come multiple times to the drive through and end up waiting more than five minutes for service.
1,"I really wanted to love this place.  It's so close, it's Fish & Chips and BBQ and other great hole in the wall fare.  Unfortunately, it has never really risen above.  If I really didn't want to cook and it was the only restaurant open in the area, sure I might give in to it.  Beyond that, it's going to be quite a while before I give them a chance again.  \n\nThe fish was fine, but the atmosphere well... it wanted to grow up and be a seedy dive bar.  Those were it's aspirations, but it wasn't quite there.  There is some seating, but not much.  If you're in the area and really want to try it, it's certainly an experience, but it's not one I want again any time soon."
1,"Once upon a time... back when Cher was just Cheryl... she used to come to Turk's all the time! When I was shorty it was so awesome! It was dark, and dank and they had pinball!! Whoo!! Huge sodas and deep fried EVERYTHING!\n\nand then I stopped coming with my mom. Recently, I gave Turk's another spin or two and although it's cleaner and bright than what it used to be... it's still not as great. \nTheir menu is what you'd expect from a fish & chips greasy spoon, nothing is really grand or amazing. Just eh. They also have a variety of mexican-american hits. Which are decent. \n\nI believe if Turk's were to move a lil east or a lil west they'd do better. With Poncho's and Pete's just a stone throw away it can't be easy to for them to stay in business. I miss the days when they made their own ketchup, tarter sauce and batter each and everyday. Now it's all prepackaged and mass produced for the the not so massive amounts of customers that frequent this place.\n\nI'm told on weekdays during lunch they get flooded with calls... but besides lunch - it's pretty much dead. It's too bad, I wish they'd work on their food a lil more. Make it something special. But alas, it's just a lil bit below average. Maybe if they brought back the old arcade games?"

4,"Incredible parish!  Great for families!  The school is fledgling, but getting better and better every year. If you haven't made an Ignatian Retreat yet, this is one of the best out of 2 places in the world to make your retreat.\n\nI prefer the intimacy of the smaller chapel, but also attended a wonderful wedding in the main church.  All around a great parish and it alone would make me move to Phoenix if I were to move anywhere else in the world."
0,"It is truly a traditional church. Very traditional. I didn't know what I was walking into and did not feel welcome. That's okay...but it is for the person seeking a very traditional service. Really, it's a conservative church, rather regressive, really."
0,"Dispensing invalid sacraments such as Confession and Matrimony is not an adequate way to run things. While the Holy See and Diocese of Phoenix have stopped short of forbidding the faithful to attend Mass here, those who do are on dangerous ground indeed. Particularly when the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite is so available here already, through the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter at Mater Misericordiae Mission as well as diocesan priests who are skilled in offering the Missal of 1962. There is essentially no reason for a faithful Catholic to frequent or support the Society of St. Pius X with their schismatic mentality, and, it does bear repeating, objectively invalid sacraments including Confession and Matrimony. Do yourself a favor and don't endanger your soul in such a way!"
0,"very traditional church, not very welcoming nor diverse, you feel like and outsider and you will never want to go back, it is regressive and feel likecyou are in the 1900 but to each is own.  I dont mind the traditional part but not feeling welcomecwas very sad and uncomfortable.  still love all my sisters and catholic brothers. went to the basilica on 3rd st and I loveeeeee it, wouldn't go back to lady of sorrow any time soon."
0,"WHY?!! Is the question of the day.\nBecause my mother said, \""Let's go to Kmart - I haven't been in forever.\""\nMe: Ugh. Okay.\n(driving south for a looo-hooong time)\nMom: Let's just turn around this is too far and this neighborhood is starting to look questionable. Why didn't you tell me it was this far?\nMe: Exactly! I did tell you it was quite a ways. But you had to experience it for yourself. Kmarts are located in low income neighborhoods and it's just around the other bend.\nMom: Okay. As long as we are here.\nMe: Ooooh! I'll meet up with you both in a few ... there's a Beauty Supply store! (skipping along) ..."
0,Talked to someone to day @ Kmart @ 336 e baseline got a camera for my daughter for a gift person I talked to was rude as hell then some one else talked to me they were more rude then the first person & said I can't return it because I don't have my receipt & there's nothing they can do sorry and hung up on me
1,"The official Going Out of Business Sale has started, so negative feelings about this Kmart were presumably universal.\n\nBy Kmart standards, it's large and clean. Which did it no good for survival because... Kmart. It's where you go when you want lower quality than Target at a higher price, which is never.\n\nThe clerk who checked me out was downright pleasant and helpful, which is worth the extra star. The security guard checking receipts at the door was charming, though I have to ask... you're GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. Does loss prevention still really matter? \n\nI'm coming up dry on finding a planned closing date for this store -- heck, I can't even find it on a list of closures, so maybe staff just spontaneously decided to cut bait -- but I'd expect it to be gone by mid-January 2015. It is specifically NOT participating in the Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday sales, nor in any future offers in the circulars in the newspaper."
4,"Ok... this old world, family owned Mexican restaurant is my favorite in all of the valley.  I have lived here for 10 years and just haven't found anything better than Poncho's.  It has been in the valley since the 50's, passed on with each generation.  The menu is as authentic as the family that runs it.  Wonderful people, and wonderful service!  My favorite items on the menu (aside from their salsa and bean dip for the nacho chips) is the Pollo Fundido and the strawberry margarita.  YAHOO!  The burrito is stuffed with chicken and chopped green chilis and cheese, then topped with melted cheese AND a jalepeno sour cream sauce.  OH YEAH.  The atmosphere is very old world... nothing fancy to say the least.  But when you make your way to South Phoenix, you surely won't be disappointed."
0,"After reading so many 4 and 5 star reviews I was hesitant to post mine thinking I just had a bad experience. I decided to try my luck again and went to Ponchos for dinner last night. I now have been there a few times and my experience has been consistently horrible. First of the all the place used to be a house, now converted to a restaurant. Usually this is a great and charming idea, but it doesn't seem to work for me. The rooms are incredibly crowded and you are either screaming at your dining partner or (loudly) overhearing the table next to you. Imagine trying to fit 5 restraunt booths in to a small bedroom.. To close for comfort.\n\nThe food - I'm sorry my fellow yelpers but I honestly think it is horrible. The chips have always been to greasy, they only serve hot sauce and you have to pay for salsa. Lame. I have had many entrees (where's the pollo under all this fundido) (chimichanga greasemanga) but last night won the \""most disgusting entree\"" award. I order the Steak Picado (I think that's what it was called) and it came out overcooked and cold. The rice and beans were barely edible, the cheese in my garnish and beans were melted stiff but there were also bits of cold (what appeared to be) sandwich cheese sprinkling the plate and hiding under the steak. It was supposed to come with tomatillo sauce but came with their normal salsa heated up..  My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was even worse, the eggs were rubbery and greasy at the same time. They were covered in a slimy sauce they passed off as ranchero but it seems like a watered down green sauce. It was so bad he didn't even eat it.\nDon't get me wrong - I love Mexican, all types and usually the heavier the better, but Ponchos is a place I will not be returning. Yes it was really cheap, but you get what you pay for.. Picture attached."
0,"My friend reminded me of the best part... When we walked outside after our horrible meal, there was a nasty used green condom on the floor. Yuck."
2,"Went there with a group of about 8 people.  I ordered a 'big' margarita...which actually wasn't bad.  The food on the menu looked good, but I was not a fan of the chips and salsa.  I know most people rave about it...but the whole squeeze bottle salsa was actually too thin for me.  I like my salsa chunky so that I can dig in with my chips.  Anyways, I ordered the my food and was happy with it.  It was very good.  Probably worth 4 stars in my book, but since I only gave this restaurant 3 stars your probably wondering why only 3 of you just said it's worth 4 stars.  Well the reason I knocked it down was because of the service.  Just not very good at all.  Our service seemed irritated everytime we asked for anything.  She only came to check on us 1 time during the whole meal.  We had to get up ourselves and go to the kitchen to get a side of sour cream and our own napkins.  I'll try them again to see if maybe she was just the bad apple of the bunch."
3,"My wife is a die hard but that's because she grew up eating here. I can say this is not a bad place for food. They make a good everything. \n\nWe had \n2x 3 way burrito green chili, red chili and bean with green sauce on top. \n1x Pollo fundito with rice (excellent)\nA ton of chips and salsa \nThe bill was slightly over $20...lol freaking MCD'S is more."
1,"Visiting Phoenix and our friends who live in town often go there.  It was super busy and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Thursday night, chips were greasy, in fact all the food was extra oily, flavors ordinary, services extra spotty as our very polite very overwhelmed waiter (with only 2 days experience) struggled to bring out food that took a long time to come and in fact one of us had not received her food and 3 of us were done.  I don't think they'll be back soon and we won't ask to go there....to bad, we were in the \""Clinton Ate Here Room\"""
3,I ordered hardshell tacos from the take out here today and they were very good. I tried this place after a friend recommended it and was happy with the tacos. Will have to try a few other menu items to get a better overall picture of what is available here.
3,"You had me at hello. You had me at hello...\n\nFor me (and my dad), I am all about first impressions, and if you have bad salsa than I am not likely going to return. Or if you make me PAY for my chips and salsa--FAIL!\n\nPancho's salsa rocks the house! \n\nTheir food is great and call me crazy, but I like eating in their seedy bar. \n\nTheir frozen margs arent too bad either.\n\nIf you want authenticity--this is the place!"
2,"Tired after a busy day, I stepped out to find a bite to eat right around home, & landed here at Pancho's for the first time.  There was a big crowd on hand for dinner, but they did manage to squeeze me in within five minutes or so, to a very comfortable booth in a small, cozy dining room.\n\nThis place has TONS of atmosphere!  It consists of a number of tastefully decorated & lighted small & medium sized dining rooms, with low ceilings & archways separating each room.  There are tables, booths, & 1/2 & 1/2, depending upon the room.\n\nChips & salsa arrived at my table soon, along with a glass of water, & my friendly waitress appeared shortly thereafter, to drop off a menu.\n\nThere is plenty to choose from here, & the prices are very reasonable.  For about $8, I had a combination plate with a chile relleno, a cheese enchilada, & a green corn tamale.  (Lunch prices are even less.)\n\nEven though they were busy, my order arrived in a reasonable amount of time, served on a piping hot platter.  I wasn't crazy about my food in particular, but I think it'll be 4-Stars if I order the right items. I did enjoy it enough return, for sure!"
2,"Cheesy.  Truly, it's a little too cheesy for my tastes, although I've grown to accept this as a normal problem with these Americanized Mexican restaurants.  But this is a great little place that has dining inside and a take-out window outside.  It's a great place to pick up an enchilada-style burrito on the way home."
3,"Ah, sweet gluttony! Poncho's is busy, loud, and has lots of personality. I really, really love the food here and I go if I'm around South Phoenix and want to eat until I pass out. I've been going here since I was little, and here are my recommendations:\n\nSalsa (tons of it!)\nFried zucchinni (only available in the dining room)\nPollo fundido \n\nThe to-go area is \""meh.\"" A lot of the menu options are not available to-go, including my beloved fried zuchinni."
0,"Back in the day I used to drive all the way from Surprise to eat here, yes the food was that good. They used to have the most killer Pollo Fundido as well as amazing chunky salsa. \n\nTime has certainly changed this place.. we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles, delicious.. nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips.. also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as I remember it. \n\nThen come my Pollo Fundido swimming, Im serious about this, swimming in a pool of grease!! They didn't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate. Was disgusting too, not even like clear oil but dark brown grease. Vile. Then the Misters Sampler showed up.. this thing was a fucking mess! You couldn't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite. Mini chimis were burnt, mini tacos burnt, tamales, cold and hard.. was a complete wreck. \n\nAfter a few bites we called it.. major loss of appetite.. a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible. \n\nMeanwhile, the Mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here.. he was sick all day the next too.. so word of caution, eat here at your own risk.\n\nIm sure going to miss the good meals I used to have here, what a real shame."
1,"Ever since my first visit seven months ago I've been meaning to get back here to order a different dinner from the menu & try to join the crowd, giving Poncho's 4-Stars.  Last time I had eaten a #11 Combo, & this time I had the #13.  Here was my impression this time:\n\nThe good:\n\nTons of atmosphere!\n\nFriendly service.\n\nA little bowl & a squeeze bottle of salsa for the chips, that gives you enough that you won't run out.  Nice!\n\nReasonable prices.\n\nGenerous servings.\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = \nThe not-so-good, in my opinion:\n\nThe poor menu!  The Combo choices miss many combinations.  They don't allow substitutions, & none of them added up to what I wanted, & would usually be able to get at a Mexican restaurant around town.\n\nMy #13 Combo came with an enchilada, tamale, taco (choice of shredded beef or chicken for each), & a tostada, attractively served, for $8.75.  Fine so far, but while the taco was ok, the rest of it was blah tasting (like the #11 last time).\n\nI'm sorry, I have to end up at 2-Stars here.  After all, if the food isn't very good, that's a biggie."
3,Green chicken tamale was amazing.  Perfect moisture.  Not to salty.  The kernels of corn added sweetness to it. There was a nice manageable amount of masa. The thing was like crack. Could not get enough.   Also had the\nChicken chile relleno.  Which was amazing tasting..       \n\nThe only downside was being tucked away in a broom closet with three other tables.      And cheddar cheese?     Go with some authentic Mexican cheese and it would have been perfect.   Eat here eat here. Cause dang its good.
1,"Just okay...now.\n\nPonchos used to be so much better than my experience today. This was actually my first time dining inside the restaurant instead of take-out. It was no doubt really cool to see the presidential room dedicated to Bill Clinton, but the food today in no way represented that prestige.\n\nAs usual with any Mexican restaurant, we got chips and salsa.Unfortunately, the salsa lacked the flavor that I remembered it having. For lunch, I got the Borracho Burro and got to try a tamale and chicken enchilada. The enchilada was okay, but the tamale flat out sucked today. It was pretty flavorless and didn't feel like it was made with any heart. My burrito was alright, but it didn't have any umph to it flavor wise... I could order the same thing at a lot of different restaurants in the valley...it was mediocre.\n\nToday was a sad day because my visit today made it just that much harder to drive out to South Phoenix to dine here. It's not just the distance anymore, but it's due to a lack of desire for Poncho's renowned dishes. \n\nI hope whatever happened here turns around, but I'm not the only one who feels this way, and that's a shame."
0,"I ate here last spring and ordered the chicken fajitas. I was served rubbery chicken that seemed to been cooked in pure salty soy sauce. My dad ordered the steak fajitas...again with the soy sauce. I was with some vegetarians (I don't remember what they ordered) but they were pretty meh about their food as well. For the 9-10$ the fajitas cost, I was expecting a little more than soy sauce seasoning.\n\nThe actual place is pretty cute and they have various rooms that are decorated well. The service was ok. The chips and salsa were the best thing about the meal. I would not eat here again."
0,"went after reading positive reviews and craving authentic mexican food. BUT this was HORRIBLE. Staples like chips and salsa were stale and bland respectively. But to make matters worse, my fajita was the most disgusting thing ever. The chicken was fried to the point that I could not chew it, and the veggies were covered in grease, and the whole thing was cooked in Soy Sauce! Is that traditional?? It was a nasty overall experience..."
0,Ew to poor service and less than desireable food!  No bueno
4,I love this place and drive about 20 miles just to eat here it has great food and great places. I always get the pollo fundidio and it is delicious every time. I have been going here for about 10 years.
4,Best mexican food in Phoenix. Good food low prices.
4,"Ate dinner here again,and as expected the bomb!!! If you like mexican food go to ponchos the pollo fundido is to die for!!  The service is awesome."
0,"Having been to Poncho's many times over the years, and never being to excited about their food and service, we happened to be out and about, and hungry Saturday 11/1 around 9pm. I remembered Poncho's serves food late, so we stopped in to give it a try. \n\nThe place we packed. Hardly an empty table which seemed like a good sign.\nService took quite a while, but there were several large parties around us, (one who clearly never heard of \""inside voices\"", but rather \""screaming voices\"") so they were busy. A simple \""hello, be right with you\"" would have been nice though, as opposed to being completely ignored.\n\nWe loved the screaming child next to us, who the parents ignored and chose to drink many beers instead of correcting his behaviur. When he knocked some holiday decorations off the wall, the parents simply set them on the floor and went back to their beer. ( not the fault of Poncho's, but indicative of the typical clientele.\nI asked about beers on tap, and was told \""Bud, Bud light, Miller). Seeems like a Mexican restaurant would have some Dos xx's , Tecate or something, but no.\n We asked how the quesadilla was, and were assured it was fantastic, so we had that, and 2 different combo plates.\n\n Well, the \""quesadilla\"" was simply 2 heated tortillas with greasy runny orange cheese. No sides, no toppings, just orange goo.\n\nOur entrees were no better. The beans were bland and tasteless, and were the burritos.. It was like eating air. \nThe beef taco was HORRIBLE. I literally watched oil run out of it as i held it up.\nI voiced my concerns, but was just given a shrug by the waitress.\n\nI used the bathroom, which was a wreck, dirty and no paper towels or soap, and headed out their door for the last time.\n\nI have never understood how people can rave about this place, but they can have it. I won't be back."
1,"How has this place stayed in business for 36 years serving the weirdest, unauthentic Mexican food ever presented on a plate? It might be because Bill Clinton ate here in 1999 and they are still getting food tourists? Not sure, but I did snap a photo of Clinton's table and that earned the extra star. The place is a mishmosh of small rooms and is old looking, but seemingly it retains its customers somehow, The guy next to us said he has been eating here once a week for the past 20 years and the waitress must have been here from day one. Have you ever heard of a waitress being too efficient, doing her job too good - kinda weird concept, but maybe somebody will get it.\n    Even though, waitress informed pop that the fajitas were cooked in Teriayki sauce (WTF?), she said they were good and he took the veteran's bait. Big Mistake because our regular told us later that they just cook the chicken in Worcesthire sauce. His plate was swimming in salty, black liquid, only one tortilla was given, the guac had no chunks and looked like green toothpaste and the original salsa served with the chips was a watery mess of slightly hot red liquid (nothing in it). The $1 chunky salsa was better, but still on par with a chain or something (no offense to the much better chains in the area). \n    My $9 combo was a mess covered in a tasteless green sauce. The enchilada tasted like stale tortillas were used and the green corn tamale was all fluff and no green chile or corn present. The chile Relleno might have been the best item, but they used a green chile, not the traditional poblano.\n     Pancho needs a break, a new menu and can someone mention to them how to cook fajitas properly because that crap should be taken off the menu forever. Clueless restaurant and even more clueless people who think this is real Mexican food. It aint."
2,"I went to Poncho's today for lunch with the BF and it was ok. The place was very busy, so I thought that was a good sign. We waited for a bit before being seated in one of the small rooms in the back. We were given chips and the salsa in the bowl and promised salsa in a bottle. The chips were very greasy and not that crunchy and the salsa tasted like very peppery ketchup...ick. After 5 minutes or so we were given the squeeze bottle which contained a very similar, but slightly less tomato -y, salsa...not a win. For lunch, I had the mini pollo fundido and the BF had a taco and tostada. My food was alright, the chicken on the inside of the burro was nothing special, but the sauce was good and the rice was really good. Sort of what I expect from a cheap Americanized Mexican restaurant. The BF's taco was fine....also nothing special, but not bad. The prices were decent and the portion sizes were too large. I think it's super funny that they are clinging to the fact that Bill Clinton ate here 15 years ago or so, they have the newspaper clippings all over....I definitely lol'd. Anyway, I wouldn't avoid this place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."
2,"Food was good. Was a lot of food too. I got the chimmi with beef and green chilli. \n\nSeating is very tight. So if ur really fat not the place to be. \n\nThe service was bla... Only saw the waitress 3times. (When she took our order, brought out our food and took our check) didn't get refills ."
3,"Sunday, and the family wants to go on a picnic. Great.\nYou have a couple of choices.\n\nFeign some sort of non-specific illness so you can sit home and watch Red Zone Channel, or tag along and act like a good parent for a change.\nYou choose the latter.\n\nThis was the drill.\n\nI called in a takeout order at Poncho's, picked it up, then drove the entire crew up to Dobbin's Lookout atop South Mountain. (About a 10 minute drive from Poncho's on Central Avenue)\n\nYup.\nA seven-mile vertical drive up South Mountain chocked with enough mountain switchbacks to ensure your entire family will be car sick upon arrival, leaving most, if not all of Poncho's feast available for your lunch tomorrow.\n\nHey, I didn't do this on purpose, things just worked-out in my favor for a change."
4,"It's exactly what I'd expect for an old school Mexican food place. Yeah, it's cramped a little. It's old. The food is the best Mexican food for white people in Phoenix. The hot sauce is to die for. Chips and fresh and endless. I love the gringo Fundito. If you're thinking about eating at this place, stop thinking and start getting down there to get a seat. It can get crowded very quickly. End of story."
0,"Food sucks, service sucks, and the atmosphere sucks.  Wish yelp allowed negative stars."
2,"So... Do NOT go with a big group on a Friday night at 7pm.  It was an hour and a half wait.  But what do you expect on a Friday night with 16 people.  Yea... we weren't exactly on our A-Game... we should have split up into groups of 4 and probably got sat a lot quicker.\n\nAs it turned out... most of our group left and by the time they had a table for us... we were down to 5.  Of course, we had been at the bar drinking margaritas and beers and eating chips and salsa.... so we weren't terribly starved when we sat down.\n\nThe margaritas are very tasty... however, was a bit bummed that the Cadillac margarita was not served with the Grand Marnier on the side.  Oh well.\n\nThe chips and salsa were Right On!  Nice and crispy chips and the salsa had a bit of nice heat and flavor different from most salsas.  It wasn't your typical pico chopped salsa... this was smooth and liquidy... but don't let that influence you til you taste it.  \n\nOnce we got around to dinner.... i had the albondigas soup... it wasn't very \""soupy\"".  It had lots of rice and like 6 medium sized meatballs... I thought it was filling and tasty.  The soup part wasn't just broth... it had a nice light beefy-tomato-y broth to it.\n\nI also helped the hubby eat some of his Muchacho Grande Burrito.  You had better be hungry when you order that.... it's freakin' huge.  There's red and green chili as well as chorizo in it.\n\nThe one knock I have on this place is the guacamole.... it's not real.  I ordered it as a side and it came out as guacamole cream.  I'm something of a guacamole snob.... i like my guac fresh with chunks of avocados.  \n\nA friend ordered the pollo fundido and it too was Huge!  and the Jalapeno cream sauce it came with was off the hook.  We dipped everything in it.  :)\n\nThis is a very local type joint.... love the local, family atmosphere.  The servers and folks here work hard and do the best they can to accommodate as many people as possible as quickly as possible.  It's not a huge place so expect a wait on the weekends because this is a local favorite.  :)"
1,"I've been coming here with my family since I was a kid. Unfortunately, it seems as though the taste of the food has gone bad, new cooks perhaps?  Although there are many that still choose to eat here, I will no longer return especially after receiving poor customer service."
2,"At Poncho's you will find good Mexican food, but there is always a weird musty smell that I can't get over.  If you do go, I reccomend the frozen margaritas.  They are poured straight out of a machine, but they are delicious."
3,I would give them a 5 but it's been a year since I've been there. Ponchos is Mexican Food to me. I compare all other food to Ponchos. I've been there easily a million times. I blame at least 50lb on my body to them. I say that in a good way. Great chips and sauce. I always get the green chili burro enchilada style. They have an awesome bean burrito too. I can review all day. Love you Ponchos. I'll be back next time I'm in town.
0,"This has to be some of the worst food in all of Phoenix. I've been here twice and I love the bartender who gave us the history of some of the tequilas and even let us sample some. He deserves a 5 star for his patience to work here; his margaritas are huge and very good too. The bar music is funk from the 70's and 80's though, that could be updated. The dining experience, is a big, giant fail. The place is disorganized from room to room and crowded. The last time, I swear our waitress hated us or her job or maybe just her life? My daughter asked a simple question about the heat of the chiles and she snapped at her with , 'sometimes they are hot and sometimes they aren't ; you get what you get. You want it or not?' We took a little longer to mull it over and she huffed and walked off. She returned about 10 minutes later to ask if we were 'ready to order this time?' When our order finally arrived, mine was wrong and I told her so; here comes that huff again and she stormed off again, when she returned she slammed the meal down and never checked on us after that. Needless to say my return factor is not even a 5%. It's Phoenix and there are about 150 other great Mexican places where the service, food, salsa and Margs are outstanding. Poor nice bartender."
1,"Arizona is known for it's amazing foodie gems you can't find anywhere else.\n\nPoncho's is, sadly, not one of them.\n\nWait! Hear me out. Before you ignore this review, understand that Arizona stands alone when it comes to Mexican food. Having eaten everywhere for Mexican food in both California and New Mexico, I can say that AZ's authenticity and flavor are incomparable. So naturally you would want to make the most of your dining experiences in Arizona and eat at places that have plates that leave a lasting impression on your palette.\n\nAlthough Poncho's may have a quaint history you want to root for, it doesn't mean that their cooking skills are the kind you want to spend a good amount for. Just because someone says they're Mexican or have a Mexican background does NOT mean that they automatically have the correct method of seasoning, prepping, or even frying.\n\nMy boyfriend and I wanted a Sunday lunch there, and we were going in with an open mind. I was actually excited that I would finally try the \""pollo fundido\"" that everyone talked about. We left a little disappointed.\n\nThe human traffic in the dining area is distracting. The setup of tables is a little weird, and although the warm paintings of desert landscape are inviting, the constant movement of waitresses, busboys, and families is...well, annoying. Then the food came. It was very, very, VERY inauthentic. The salsa for the chips was literally a tomato paste that resembled something like ketchup with some spices thrown into it. The meal was heavy; it was greasy and felt more like a fast food combo that wouldn't keep me full for too long. Great meals leave you satisfied, but here I couldn't eat much. I looked around and noticed that the crowd that ate at this place really didn't care if the food was bland or nothing close to the beautiful mom and pop shops that would put the food to shame. It was saddening and a little frustrating to know that they were missing out. \n\n\""Can I be honest with you?\"" My boyfriend asked. \n\""I could get something just like this at Del Taco.\""\n\nMr. Clinton, if you come back to Phoenix, I can show you places that would blow your mind."
0,"I like the atmosphere because the servers and bus-boys are always fooling around with you and having fun, and their service is ok,but this place still has many problems. \n \nFirst is the room inside, this place makes lots of money and it would be nice to have a little more room inside. \n \nI have been coming here my whole life and the food is always good, but you get a sense that this place isn't as sanitary as it should be. \n \nIn the past i would recomend this place a lot but after hearing a lot of stories from friends and recent experiences i have decided not to come anymore, and recomend you do the same."
1,"I'm giving this place two stars only because I enjoyed the chips and salsa. I ordered a combo of a Tostado,enchilada and A tamale. The tostado shell was overcooked, the enchilada was unremarkable and the Tamale had very little meat in it and tasted just like the enchilada . . I honestly had one bite of everything on my plate and then pushed it aside. My son ordered something else and he did not eat his meal either. My daughter in law had a green chili burrito and she loved it. So if you must go to this place try and order that. I wont be going back."
3,"The food here is very good. We go here sometimes for work. No one ever complains, and we've been back multiple times."
4,"My husband and I love this place! I get something different every time and it's always delicious! On the lighter side, their marinaded grilled chicken with rice and beans was so simple but just as delicious and satisfying as when I ordered a chimichanga. I love their margaritas too! This place can do no wrong."
0,"I Was was so excited to have lunch there. since moving to AZ i have heard so many great things about this restaurant however when I got there totally disappointed the culinary experience hasn't caught up yet in Phoenix,AZ the food was less than mediocre, And the counter tops at the bar were sticky;( this old mom-and-pop joint, is thumbs down for me.......;("
4,"My husband and I were driving by and we seen a lot of cars out in the parking lot so we decided to stop, hoping this is some good Mexican food.  Not from Phoenix but everyone knows that If there is a lot of cars must be good! Of course that must be true because it was so good!!! I got the shredded beef chimichanga with red chili .....yum! So delish!  According to yelp its a popular stop, glad I came here and of course I'll be back soon!"
2,"We didnt feel like going out and decided to order in.  Compared to most delivery restaurants of this style, we were happy not to get a salt bomb for a meal.  Only quibbles were ordering two larges and only getting one rice and their online menu not being accurate with regards to pricing.  Good flavor on the Kung pao."
3,Cheap and delicious!  Can't beat that.
0,"I WILL NOT eat here ever again!!! I used to love this place great specials, delivery and good chinese food. The last and final time I ordered from here I got my delivery order and found a handful of baby roaches in my chow mein, that was 3 years ago. I have not eaten here since and I never will return"
0,They will not deliver past 4 miles. I pulled up delivery and there name came up. I was so excited. I gave them a call they asked for my cross streets. I told them and the kid that answered the phone said we can't deliver that far out. I then called back to ask for a manager. He said they are to busy to deliver that far.
0,"I was desperate for Chinese today and I found a spot that delivered,  so I was super amped. I have never tried this spot before, so I was a little apprehensive,  but nonetheless,  I went for it. The lady who took my order was pleasant and the food came to us very fast, but as soon as I opened the door to receive my food,  I got a whiff of a strange smell. Not the wonderful smell of good quality Chinese,   but some straight gutter,  low quality ish. I opened the bag and the smell of old grease and burnt food hit my nostrils. I order veggie fried rice,  veggie egg rolls and fried chicken wings.  And all of it smelled old af.  I made sure I said a prayer before I ate the food.  The egg rolls tasted like cinnamon fried something, so pretty much... I was eating everything that they fried the the food in,  so basically I got a  Chinese food bonus,  everything I ordered plus the free taste of old fried desert... It's my lucky day!  The Rice had the same fried,  sweet,  dirty taste.  I threw all of it away, and the  chicken was greasy af... So greasy I could use it on the creaky  door hinges in my house, enough to shine your shoes,my shoes and even  enough grease to use on my face so I can prepare for battle and give them a straight up ass whopping for serving this disgusting food. \n I abhor this place,  and so should you."
4,"Dr. Yochum and his staff are fantastic.  He is a straight shooter and will give you his honest opinion which at times may not be what you wanted to hear, but it is what you need to hear.  I have taken my greyhounds to him for eight years and he has dealt with many various issues including the cancer one of my dogs developed.  When the day came to send my dog to the rainbow bridge, he was honest and told me what I needed to do.  Many of his staff have been there the entire time I have utilized his services.  And you can tell that he loves what he does and he loves the patients that he cares for."
0,"Ripoff, unprofessional and rude staff!  The reason I took my dog to this Vet was because of the reviews and the phone call I had with them prior to visiting.  I wanted to be aware of the cost and be able to compare with other vets.  My dog was itching like crazy and had scabs everywhere.  I called and asked how much the tests would be on top of the exam fee.  They told me they don't do allergy tests but other tests would be included in the exam.  OK great, thinking I could save some money since it is probably mites; he's been on the same premium food for a long time and nothing has changed so it can't be allergies.  So I had my husband bring the dog there while I'm at work.  They did a simple scrape test and charged him for it!!!!!!!!!!!  Told him it's allergies and now we don't know what he's allergic to.  That's fine but don't charge me for something you said you weren't going to charge!!!!  Now I have to take him to another vet to find out what he's allergic to!  I called them back to see why they had gave me misleading information and the receptionist was extremely rude and unprofessional.  All she could do was lie and make excuses.   I am extremely upset and will not be going back to this location!"
4,North Phoenix and Scottsdale vets quoted $2K to $3k to fix entropian eyelid on my rescued and traumatized CHOW CHOW 4 year old.   He understood the dog - did all the work - major surgery - had to leave my Chow for surgery overnight -  medications afterward and healed fantastic for less than 1/3 the cost.\n\nAWESOME VET WHO does great work
4,"I love this place!  \n\nEven though they don't take appointments, I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get into a room.\n\nDr. Yocham is great at presenting options that save you money. \n\nI have already recommended him to a friend and would recommend this office to anyone looking for a vet."
4,"I have to say they are great....since they don't take appointments, it's kind of first come, first served, but they were able to fix my dogs chronic cough in no time!"
4,"I love this clinic. They are a bit hard to get to, but worth it. I've only seen Dr. Yocham with my two dogs and he's been very professional and friendly. My dogs love him, he's very no nonsense and doesn't try to tack on a lot of extras that may not be necessary. He offers his opinion and lets you decide without pressure what course of action to take. I trust his judgement and I appreciate that he doesn't make you feel like a bad owner. \n\nThey do not take appointments, but like the others said, I usually get into a room within a few minutes, and only wait about 10 once in there for the Doctor or the Tech to come in. \n\nThe ladies at the Admin counter are very friendly too. One was very helpful and worked up an estimate and walked me through all of it when I was concerned with dental costs. \n\nOverall I would recommend this place and Dr. Yocham. It's not fancy, but really who needs a fancy vet? All you get is a fancy price tag if you're concerned about all the frills that some offer."
0,If you love your pet and dont have any knowledge on how to care for them when they are ill please dont go to this place ! Go to a place that cares about animals and that is knowledgeable on treatment. They told us that our puppy had the begining stages of parvovirus and that it would be 1800 to treat him for it if we left him in their care.(Dont leave your pets with them !) I opted for a second opinion and they still charged almost 50 dollars just for walking in ! (They know what they can do with that !) The service was as if i was a second class citizen which i am by Euro standards but I'm in no way as ignorant as this staff. I got my puppy taken care of by an elderly lady at the pet store on Broadway between central and 7th. Im disgusted by people who are only out to make a quick buck at the expense of someones care for their pets ! (P.S.) They wont even mention that Tamiflu will save your puppy from parvovirus but the humane society will !
4,"We went for brunch on the recommendation of some friends that live in the area.  What a great choice!  The setting is fantastic....you're just outside in a great little garden area.  And the food was amazing.  I'm a bit of a champagne nut (I think I mention champagne in every review I write....) and I loved the fact that they give you a mini bottle and a mini carafe of oj to mix yourself!  I also found it funny that the woman at the table next to ours used all of her OJ and I used only a little bit....mmmmm...its just to color, right? ;)"
3,"Great sandwiches and a BEAUTIFUL atmosphere. \n\nThe Farm is a perfect place to spend an afternoon with a huge group or just one special person. If you're going, try to reserve some extra time, there's a lot of nice walking to be done and it's just not worth going if you can't relax and enjoy the environment.\n\nA couple words of caution: Don't bother going in the summer. The whole experience is about being outside and, well...\n\nAlso (and this is the restaurant's only real downfall) the sandwiches are PRICEY! Most average around $10 and that's before you add on a side or drink."
3,"The Farm is a perfect place for a romantic picnic, a group, a family, and I imagine even an escape if you want some alone time... the grounds are well kept and beautiful.  Dog friendly also.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because they run out of salads that are on the menu if you get there later in the afternoon... (I guess they only make a certain # of salads per day so if you snooze, you lose!)  However, sandwiches are made to order and delicioius...  The iced tea is really good here, and so are all of the deserts.  \n\nSince it's located so close to South Mountain, I recommend going for a hike before and working up an appetite before heading over to the Farm for lunch.\n\nThere are picnic tables, or you can bring a blanket.  I went with a group of people last weekend and we brought a football to play catch... we had a blast!  Make sure you call ahead for their hours of operation.  As I recall, they close at 3pm on Sundays and they will kick you out if they have to because I think there is a gate or fence they close as well."
2,"The Farm at South Mountain was the recent cite of a Mom playdate my friend and I scheduled when it happened that both of our moms were in town over the same weekend.  \n\nWe went to the breakfast place, which worked out well because I probably would have lost my mom to baby fever if we'd gone to the lunch spot, as there were several tables of baby shower celebrations set up there.  \n\nI thought the food was alright, but not great.  I loved the fruit salad that my mom ordered and thought that the mint syrup was an innovative touch that really classed up a pretty standard assortment of melon.  The egg burrito thing I ordered was on the rubbery side.  I'd definitely go again.  If only for the mini bottles of champagne.   It is nice to sit outside and look at all the flowers and eaves drop on the young couples and watch all the baby shower guests cart huge gift bags from the parking lot across the street to gingham covered tables under the shade trees.  \n\nI hope Del Web or some other super developer doesn't purchase all the surrounding land and totally ruin the illusion or originality and quaintness created by a brunch at the Farm."
4,"The Morning Glory Cafe is excellent.  My boyfriend took me here for the first time to meet some of his family, and I just fell in love.  I like the atmosphere and the food is hearty.  I scheduled a morning brunch with all of my girlfriends there a few weeks ago and it went off without a hitch.  The staff is great!"
4,"We've been twice now for Sunday brunch, most recently yesterday when we took my in-laws, and both times have been fabulous. It's amazing that a place so serene and beautiful exists in the middle of a metropolitan area.  Both times we have had to wait, but nothing too long. Yesterday there were some vendors set up outside Morning Glory Cafe, so my inlaws shopped a bit while waiting.\n\nThe food is absolutely delicious! I love how they use fresh and seasonal products, which I think makes it even better.  The American breakfast is standard breakfast but enough food to make me full without being stuffed. My husband had the belgian waffle yesterday and let me have a bite...it was awesome. Plus the whipped cream they give you with it is so light and refreshing...needless to say I ate the rest of it when he was done!  My mother-in-law loved her eggs benedict and had to give half to my father-in-law because the portions were so large. My father-in-law had the chicken enchalidas...delicious! Everyone at the table snagged some...the tomatillo sauce was so flavorful.  I love how they give you your own mini champagne bottle for mimosas.  I'm not sure what the final bill was because my father-in-law paid, but the first time we went for brunch, I think it was around $50 for my husband and I with tip.\n\nAfter eating, make sure to wander around the property. The Artist's Studio and The Cottage are very cute and full of art and jewelry for sale.  We met the artist in residence yesterday and she was super nice. The artists in residence change every so often, so each time you go, you'll likely see something new."
2,"Being 72, I felt my parents tremble a bit when I said I was taking them to the \""farm\"". Growing up in the midwest, it wasnt rare to hear \""somebody bought the farm\"". This did not mean an uncle decided to purchase a ranch, but rather, met his maker, is now six feet under or my favorite, \""he's in a better place now.\"" That said, my folks were delighted at our Farm experience. It's always a challenge getting dad a plain sandwich in any restaurant but they were very accommodating. Mom and I both enjoyed our turkey sandwiches and the ice tea is extra good. Maybe it's brewed in the sun. That would be very farm-like, no? Now, I get the whole theme here with the picnic tables and all. Just not a big fan of it myself. That, and walking on grass. Ewww! But it's called the Farm and not the City, so no points docked for that. Really a unique Phoenix experience with a gift shop, walking trails and the smell of dirt. So hitch up your tractor and git on down to the Farm."
2,"Cute cute spot and a fun idea... but I cannot get past the fact that even with plastic silverware, picnic style containers... and no servers, our bill was astronomical.  Be careful how much you get!\n\nAnyway, the soup was the best part.  The bread was ridiculously hard on my sandwich.  The Pecan Pie was gelatin-ish and weird.\n\nBut it is fun to sit outside in this nice space."
1,it is a place that everyone wants to like just because of its topography.Yes it is different from most here in AZ. Nice and peaceful. But I can find that in my back yard. I do not think the food is too spiffy. My sandwich bread was so hard it came close to cutting my gums and yes I do have healthy gums. The taste was of no particular flavour to the point that I can not remember what I ate. I get the feeling the customers are trying to hard too. This place is just not for me.
3,BOTTOM LINE: I love the soup & sandwiches. I can bring my dog.
3,"Morning Glory offers great French toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8rlTOw0IA1TENURMBJpaXw?select=-4feMjhfMVa68yPeJJeZ1Q#-4feMjhfMVa68yPeJJeZ1Q and good omelettes.  The Farm Kitchen sells great sandwiches and a few tasty pastry selections.  Side salads are pricy considering the size portions.  Haven't had a chance to dine at Quiessence, yet, but I've read great reviews.\n\nBTW, one can also get massages here at The Retreat!  I've never been, but there is a sign that says \""by appointment only.\""  There used to be a giftshop where one can buy natural beauty and skin products, but that's long gone (I used to get e-newsletters).  Those products used to be sold at a location next to the vegetarian/vegan restaurant that used to be on Goldman and 5th in Scottsdale, but that also closed a year or two ago..."
2,I have always enjoyed the atmosphere at the Farm. The menu is served cafeteria style so its quick service. My favorite part is finding a seat amongst the pecan tree orchard at a picnic table - makes me feel like Im at a picnic. If you visit at the right time of year - all of the foliage is blooming\nA little bit of a drive for me - but when has that ever stopped me!??\nEverytime I eat there though - I have not been impressed by the food. The salads ok....the pastries have you salivating while in line but nothing special.\nIts too bad because they get the thumbs up on everything else.
3,"\""I would give the location 5 stars and the restaurant 3, so we're at 4 stars overall.\nI went with hubski and a couple of friends for a nice weekend picnic. The experience would have been a 5-star one if we had brown-bagged it, but as it was, we purchased food from the quaint little house-converted-to-restaurant. Hubski and I shared a veggie sandwich and a peach pie thing. Tasty, but most definitely overpriced. The iced tea was tasty and refreshing, but still, sharing a meal with a drink each, it should have been less money.\nI'll go back for the ambiance. It's definitely kid and dog friendly, but we'll bring a big blanket, some kid toys, a dog or three, and lunch in a brown bag... we'll still buy pastries though.\"""
1,"An interesting venue - definitely mixed feelings re. this review - take it with a grain of salt if you want to visit, but otherwise, consider other options if you have them.\n\nJoan and I were visiting her sister in Phoenix, and, to be honest, we had no idea where to go and consulted Yelp.  This place came up first for breakfast in the rankings, and I'm not surprised.  I don't know much about Phoenix, but relative to my standards of NY/LA, there's not much there.  We were very happy to drive up to the farm, park, and sit down at a very nice table in a beautiful, popular, semi-rustic setting.  The weather was perfect and the atmosphere delightful.  \n\nService was also great to start, coffee was self-serve and tasty too  ...... if only the food had been good as well.  I hate to give two stars, but Joan's frittatta was straight-up cold and rubbery.  Doesn't get much worse than that - the waitstaff warned us that it was 'served at room temperature,' but seemed like that was all-too-subtle code for 'just don't order this - it's bad.'  Wish they had just said that.\n\nI had Eggs Benedict and it was so-so OK, but not good enough to balance it all out.  In the end, the waitstaff switched through shifts too and they messed up the bill, so that didn't help either.  But more than anything it was the mediocre food that earned the two stars here - I hope they improve it, as the setting was delightful, but until they do I can't recommend the place.  \n\n(As an alternative, though...what else, exactly, is in Phoenix?)"
2,"Love to go for brunch on Sunday's. The food is always great but the service can be slow. If you're not in a hurry, enjoy the atmosphere...that's half the reason you should go there. They are supposed to have great bloody mary's however last time we were there they ran out of their mix and instead of telling us they ran out, they made a new mix with whole tomatoes. Although I give them credit for improvising I couldn't even drink through the straw it was so thick! It also had absolutely no flavor.  I ended up paying for a whole tomato in a glass even after I told the waitress I was unhappy with the drink. The food was delicious!"
2,"We only had breakfast/ brunch at the Morning Glory, so i can't comment on any other feature of the Farm\n\n- Cute place; looks like a small, family-run farm\n- loads of picnic tables (and as we were driving out around 11a, we noticed a long line of cars parked along the gravel) \n- the setting would be great for baby and wedding showers, great for groups \n\nFood:\nI had the Gourmet  Wild Mushroom Omelet with a side of sausage\n- Home fries and Biscuit were a 3*\n- Omelet was ok, with a too-thick hollandaise sauce; 2.5* at best\n- Sausages were awful; really dry and cold\n- Coffee was lukewarm; not very tasty\n\nEveryone else's food looked pretty good, including the benedicts and tacos."
1,"I love the atmosphere here but the food has taken a turn for the worst.  This used to be my favorite breakfast place but something has changed.  The food looks like the chef does not care.  There was no garnish on the plate, my eggs were cold.  My friend's waffles were burnt.  This is a lovely place to visit with a friendly wait staff but I do not recommend the food."
3,"A nice place to have a sandwich and enjoy the open space!. Good to brunch in a big group. I still haven't try the morning glory cafe, but soups and sandwiches feel FRESH!"
1,"I visited the Farm for the first time today and frankly, was disappointed. I was expecting freshly prepared items and homegrown produce, and instead was met with a cafeteria counter of prepackaged salads that looked like they came straight from Circle K. Even the iced tea was not freshly brewed, but came from a dispenser. \n\nThe Red Grape and Walnut salad was good, but the plastic container it came in was too small for tossing ingredients and for $10 I expected something MUCH better and bigger. I've heard the soups are good and the desserts looked awesome, but I'm not sure if I'll return."
2,"We've always loved going to the farm for breakfast on the weekends.  There's always a wait, but you couldn't ask for a better place to wait!  We let the kids run around, the dog gets to walk, we stop and chat with Maya over at the farm stand, buy some things to plant in the garden.... pretty much a perfect morning if you ask me! \n\nIt seems though, that the food just isn't what it used to be.  On our most recent visit, my husband's omelette had hardly any cheese in it, the french toast that our girls shared wasn't that great, and the \""apple butter\"" it came with wasn't really apple butter.  Maybe it's an east coast thing that people don't know about out here, but apple butter doesn't contain butter at all.  Not in my book.  But, as I was saying, this was just apple-cinnamon flavored butter.  It was tasty, but I thought I would be adding something somewhat nutritious to their french toast when I requested it.  Quite the opposite...  To continue, the gravy for my country fried steak tasted fantastic- peppery and creamy and delicious!  But my eggs were completely undercooked and I had to send them back.  My husband was charged for a coffee he didn't get, and overall I think it was a bit pricey for the quality.  \n\nWe'll probably be giving it another chance soon since it's just a great way to spend the morning and so close to the places we like to hike."
2,"this review is for the morning glory cafe met friends this morning for breakfast parked right after entering enjoyed a nice walk to morning glory restaurant casual dining all outdoors I had white truffle scramble w/lots of fresh vegies and a side order sausage, tasted fine my only complaint was that the food was barley warm my wife had a omlet with the same complaint we did not say anything and our friends did not mention it but my guess is the food was probley the same. service was good and setting was nice"
3,"Haven't eaten at the farms restaurant. We went on Mothers Day and the menu seemed a bit pricey. \n\nBut, we did shop at the farmers market (bought bread and some produce.) Then we sat down on the picnic tables and had a wonderful brunch eating what we had purchased at the market. \n\nThere is a neat art studio towards the back of the farm. Staff was very friendly and helpful. \n\nThere is a cool chicken coop that the kids can walk up to, the garden is right by the market which is an education tool for teaching our city kids where food comes from.  \n\nThis farm inspired my family to put in a large garden and raise 3 chickens in our backyard. \n\nIt is great for an early summer morning outing with the family."
3,"It's so nice to stroll around this old pecan farm. You really feel like you're in the rural country side. I love the garden, the towering trees, the shade. It's lovely. \nBest chocolate cake I've ever had is from here. And amazing soup and sandwiches. A little more on the pricier side, but worth it. \nI've been a couple times and have never had a bad experience with service. It's too bad they shut down in the summer. I understand during the day, but in the evening this place would be delightful to have dinner."
4,"It's really called Morning Glory Cafe.\nIt's on a farm that's all organic. My sister asked \""Do you think they spray for flies?\"" but immediately noticed the incongruity.\n\nThe sausage at the breakfast place was really good.\n\nAn admin at Yelp needs to move these reviews over there. I give it a 5 mostly to counteract the one-star. Otherwise, I didn't pay, but I'd give it at least a 4 on taste.\n\nLook for the rest of the reviews for this place here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:YAbb2MOxdLvD4qkvlO7Wug/src:search/query:The%20Farm"
4,"Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good."
1,"If you like spending $25 per person for a breakfast that includes flies, bird droppings and an extremely long wait (40 min) then this is for you!!!  In our exhaustive search for a breakfast restaurant in PHX that has NY style home fries, this unfortunately fails.  Although the Benedict itself was good, the tiny portions, soggy overseasoned home fries and aforementioned service/atmosphere make this outdoor experience a good place to skip.  I'll see you at Matt's, that is far worth the wait!"
3,Went to Morning Glory and had their french toast with candied pecans. It was delicious! Loved being outside and enjoyed the atmosphere so much.
4,Really great bfast and beautiful setting. Great for kids.
1,"I have wanted to go here for brunch for a long time.  Finally made it there this past weekend.  Great setting -- so pretty and unique and reminds that Phoenix can be awesome.\n\nI arrived at 11:30 and had a 20 minute wait. No big as it gave me time to walk the grounds.  Was seated, odered the ham & cheese omelletee with home fries.  Food took about 30 minutes, again no biggie but something to be aware of if you are hungry and/or with children.\n\nFood was dropped off with not much fan fare.  Immedietly I saw a black hair sticking out of the fries.  Eww and Hello!  Did no one see this?  Ate the omelette, was very good but found two more very long black hairs intertwined in the fries.  It was gross.  One hair falls out --ok its unfortunate, but this...was like someone had pulled these long hairs out in wrapped them up in the fries.\n\nNo thanks."
3,Breakfast is fantastic.  Work on the coffee selection.  Only thing holding back a star is no French press coffee or an espresso machine
3,"With a \""moo-moo\"" here and a \""moo-moo\"" there... Everywhere a \""moo-moo\""!  Sorry that was the first thing that came to mind when I was  asked to go to the farm for lunch.   As first timers , we were a little confused on where we suppose to start, but there was a long line of people, with no food, holding menu's... so we started there. As a vegetarian I was pleasantly surprised with the variety in their menu.  In fact I changed my mind five times before we got up to order.  I ended up with a 1/2 Farm Fresh Veggie sandwich, a cup of bean soup and finished up with butternut squash creme brulee. The food was excellent, in fact I had to restrain from licking my soup bowl clean.  The only downside is it took forever to come out, and to top it off, I had to get a redo on my sandwich because they smothered it in Mayo (Which I do not eat, EVER!).  Despite the semi-chaotic service and delivery, it's hard to complain about getting a great meal, and enjoying in such a beautiful setting. The tables are set up along side the farm, and surrounded by huge trees.  I am really looking forward to coming back and giving their breakfast a shot!"
1,although the location and seating outside were great the place scored very low on recent visit for lunch. very pricy for what u get pre made salads looked small and unappelling. our sandwiches were lacking the main ingreditants which left them very small mostly bread which was dry. soup was cold a..even with our groupon coupon our bill for 3 people was $20 would not recommend this place ..
1,"the sandwich was amazing....but defintiely not worth $9. I've definitely had better.  It didn't even come with a side. great location and outdoor seating, but overrated."
0,"there were too many flies, it is outside and people bring their dogs\nto sit on the chairs.  Everything from the trees flies on the table and in your food.   There is no accessability for the handicapped at all, there is no pavement, you are walking in mud and on rocks.    Also the bathrooms\nare awful and no one wears gloves at all!!!!"
3,I love the atmosphere at the Farm (when it's not too hot) and the food is pretty darn good every time I've gone.  The downsides are it's a little pricy and gets pretty crowded when it's nice out.
4,Just plain excellent every time!! Love it! Food and setting are fantastic! They do a good job for Arizona!! Probably one of the best breakfast/brunch places in Phoenix! This is one of those spots that actually is good even if you have to wait to get a seat!
4,"Deep within a pecan grove, is a small organic farm that has a small cafe. which prepares its food with using the organic vegetables and herbs.  \n\nIt is an anomaly and is always popular for those who want to get away from suburban sprawl.  \n\nIt is a little pricey for breakfast, but it is worth the splurge."
0,"Four stars for the food.\nAnother cumulative star for the service, making them a solid five.\nThat was before we checked out.\n\nMinus five for their not having a defibrillator anywhere on site when my heart began missing beats right after their informing me how two cups of turkey soup, one half sandwich, a whole sandwich, two iced teas, a cookie and a small slice of bread pudding came to forty-seven bucks.\n\nI must have appeared to the cashier as a mouth-breather and to everyone else in line when I stood there, frozen, vegetatively reverberating;  \""huh....forty-seven bucks...really...how is that even possible???\n[head shake]\n\nEventually, my friend's laugher brought me back. \n\nBut it was my turn to pay for lunch, so I couldn't tell them to stuff their forty-seven bucks and walk out. This place is in the middle of BFE, with nowhere else to eat except the desert, and I don't care for cactus or rocks...so I sucked it up\nand did the only thing I could do under the circumstances.\n\nI sat there eating my lunch....fixating on how I'd just blasted through one fifth of my unemployment check on a fucking turkey sandwich. \n\nNot going back."
2,"My wife had a tuna sandwich and I had the flank steak. We bot had a small iced tea. The total was $31. which is quite high for  two drinks & sandwhiches with no sides. \nThe rating I gave was an overall rating.\n To break it down, I would say the food was good, but not exceptional, so 4 stars. The value rating would be 1 star, based on just two base sandwhiches & two drinks. Atmophere; you eat outside and most of the tables are right off 32nd st so it's a little noisy. Just basic plastic chairs so nothing fancy, so 3 stars. The staff here gets 5 stars; nice and friendly.\nI came here to scheck out what all the high ratings were on both yelp and urban spoon. I don't think I will come back."
1,"The Farm at South Mountain is beautiful and a real gem of the Valley.\nBut the restaurants are FAR to expensive to even bother trying the food!\nA sandwich at the Farm Kitchen can cost you no less than $10!! And that is all you get for the price-a sandwich, not even a pickle on the side!\n\nThe small treats, like bars, muffins, etc. are expensive as well.\n\nSo...to really enjoy the beautiful landscape, pack a picnic and walk around the property. They have a beautiful shaded picnic table area, large garden, and artists' cottages. \n\nIt really is a great place to experience actual greenery and you can make your time there even better by preparing a picnic to enjoy!"
2,"Cool set up! We liked the feel of the place. The food was good, but I guess we were hoping for really good. We would return but only if we were in the area."
3,Great outdoor option for Phoenix people
3,"An excellent little place to have a picnic lunch!  Prices are a bit high, but the atmosphere and use of local products for the food is great!  We will be back."
2,"I just moved here from CA and I had NO IDEA that something like this could exist in the desert. The farm is absolutely gorgeous!\n\nThis review is based on the Breakfast restaurant, not the lunch or dinner restaurant. I haven't tried those places yet.\n\nWe have come here twice now for Breakfast. I wanted to give the place another shot before writing a review.\n\nThe first time we came on a Sunday. The place was packed, expect to wait at least 30 minutes. The table we were seated at was slanted since the tree roots had brought up the pavement. Neg 1.\n\nThe back of the menu talks about how the Farm is into recycling, the environment, etc... So I told the server that I wanted the eggs benedict. I will pay the full price of the meal but I just wanted half an order (so I didn't waste any food). We spent about 5 min going back and forth about how if I just got half an order I would still have to pay full price (as I already said I would). Then someone else came out and told me I would have to pay full price, I said I understood that, I just didn't want to waste any food. Finally, my order comes out she says \""sorry the kitchen is too busy so you have to get the full order.\""\n\nMy eggs were okay but I think they forgot to toast the muffins so the meal didn't taste good.\n\nThe second time we went there, we decided to try going during the week so it wouldn't be as busy. Well, we got the same sucky server. She forgot to bring me my orange juice until the end of the meal and forgot to bring me my lemon. The menu is smaller during the week. The biscuits didn't taste fresh which is one of their signature items. The bacon tasted and felt like it had been on the burner all morning. She brought out sausages for my husband when he ordered bacon.\n\nWe will not be going there for breakfast again... If we do, we will bring our own breakfast and eat at the picnic tables."
3,"We ate here on Mothers Day at the Morning Glory Cafe. Our food was great. Everyone in our group cleared their plates. I had the Juevos Rancheros and it did not dissapoint. I also tried the French toast and the sausage gravy. Everything amazing. We had good service too!  We got lucky and were seated in the shade.  The only part I didnt like was that it was up to us to find out own high chair and we could only find 2 in the entire resturant and they were in use.  I think the staff should find the high chair, especially since when we made a reservation, we said we needed 2."
1,Over priced sandwiches!!!\nTasteless Flank Steak Sandwich (nothing else) and a bottled coke $16\nSurrounding area with picnic tables was nice though.
3,"This place is great. A gem inside the city.\n\nMy sister took us here as she knew we'd never had a dining experience like this, and it was pretty enjoyable.  Lots of picture-taking settings.\n\nFood is worth the price.  It's straight from the farm, mind you. How many places can say that?  When you have regular places in Chicago that sell sammies at $12-20 a pop, you will value what you get from the Farm.  I had their special that day - a herb roasted chicken sandwich along with some tasty tomato bisque.  Everything tasted very fresh.\n\nHuge area of picnic tables to sit and watch or bring a blanket and sit on the grass.  There is so much to explore with different boutiques, cafes, and shops all over the the lot.  Hope to come back for brunch or breakfast someday."
2,Not that great! For the prices I expected much better food. Lacked that special something and pretty small portions. Outdoor breakfast seating was beautiful and staff was sweet. Just left me desiring more....
0,"Hello,\nAnd I hope this review does exactly what I intend for it to do. Get the principals of this joke for a restaurant,  who ever they are,  to read it and wake up. Obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this place.\n\nLet's start at the beginning, went for lunch, walked in, saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us. NOPE!! nothing of the sorts, walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance, again what do I do next? People inside look at you but don't ask to help you. We had our dog with us, so I asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out. She walked to the counter and again no one would help. Can I order? Then a person replied and pointed \""you start down there\"" Okay great, were getting somewhere. She placed an order for a salad (pre-made crushed into a small container) a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade. she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said ' let's find a table, I have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich\"" \n\n I sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street (This is a farm?) and she went to get the sandwich.  OH the daymare has just started. After about 20 minutes, she sent me a text and said,\"" I haven't left you, still waiting\"" This is Chicken Salad People!!! slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and it's ready to go. Here's where it gets really good, several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella. My girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting, she taps on the window and asks \"" is there a problem with the chicken salad.\""  \""I'll check\""  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich.  Now I would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes, and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said \""how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich\"" he had been waiting 30 minutes.\n\nWe eat what I would say is ordinary fresh food, nothing to write home about, and because I found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous, I stopped back in to express myself and politely said  \""This is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never return\""\n\nTheir response, exactly like the whole experience started. NOTHING.\n\nAnd although we typically know what items cost before we eat anywhere, so initially the price seemed okay but this place is definitely OVERPRICED."
2,"Great atmosphere if you enjoy eating outdoors. I'll ditto what other reviewers have said regarding the cost of the food...it's pricey. We've been here for breakfast and lunch and enjoyed it both times however average cost for a sandwich, drink and chips is $20."
4,"I'm mortified!  I've never written a review of the Farm at South Mountain?  I'm not sure how this is even possible!\n\nI go here so often that this might actually be my favorite place in Phoenix to go for a relaxing cool/warm Saturday or Sunday afternoon in PHoenix.  In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.\n\nMany people write reviews for the various \""businesses\"" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several \""businesses\"" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in \""Stoned Grove\"" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too... \n\nOne of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.  \n\nHere are my reviews of places on the farm:\n\nMaya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.)\nOrganic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)-\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/mayas-farm-phoenix#hrid:5dPGtdn4SQIClbJ_uIe1zw\n\nSucculentia (it is in the green house on the north side of the farm, back by Maya's garden House)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/succulentia-phoenix#hrid:Z91CIQ4jVqF9RG3HrRe22w\n\nThe Farm Kitchen \n(Lunch/Brunch and is the closest to the Picnic Tables.  you see it immediately as you enter the farm, north of  \""The Farm Driveway\"".)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-farm-kitchen-phoenix#hrid:7w3mgerwC9Yqd_b1amkDjA/src:self\n\nMorning Glory \n(Breakfast only, but the patio is a nice place to rent for an event.  Go All the way to the end of the Farm Drive and YOu'll find it.)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:yzI8RxBsNlKndP1HMQ0Q6A\n\n\nThere are a few other businesses on the Farm listed on Yelp\nWeddings:\n(I am sure there was a wedding listing on Yelp for the FASM because I used to check in to it accidentally when I first started Yelping.  If I find it, I will update)\n\nQuiessence (I haven't written a reveiw of this either.  SMH!!):\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix\n\nBotanica (Been here once, but no review)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/botanica-phoenix-3\n\nThis is a great place to visit after you've completed a Hike on South Mountain too.  Enjoy.  Thank me later."
1,"I don't know whether this is a real farm that is serving home-grown food, or a Potemkin Village masquerading as a farm. The sandwiches were fine, if heavy on the mayo. And how can any self-respecting farm be serving sodas sweetened with artificial flavors and corn syrup in this day and age? A sandwich in a picnic basket doth not maketh Ye Olde Farm."
3,"Fantastic spot, try the smoked brisket hash! The prices are a little high (2.95 for coffee, but free refills) but well worth it if you're looking for a nice bfast/brunch. Get there early, weekends get busy!! Bring your dog!"
4,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place during our visit to Phoenix for Spring Training. Wow! Driving into this place you forget that you are in the desert. We arrived a little before 9am on a Sunday and were happy we did because by 9am every table was filled and people were pulling in pretty quickly. \n\nAfter we were seated the waitress said the coffee and water was self serve which I thought was pretty convenient. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so I was really torn about what to order. I ended up ordering the farm burrito and I was happy I did. The burrito was filled with scrambled eggs, tepary fried beans, cotija cheese and chorizo wrapped in a flour tortilla, it was fabulous. The burrito came with a side of home fries and just to warn everyone the portions are huge. I ended up only earring half of the burrito. My boyfriend ordered the farm omelette which is a popular item on the menu. Filled with fresh vegetables and a side of home fries let's just say he cleaned his plate. \n\nThe ambience was great and the views were fabulous. As we were leaving we noted that this will definitely be a go to place whenever we come back to Phoenix. Such a gem of a find."
4,The food was fantastic.   The service was excellent.  The wine list was interesting and varied.  Highly recommend this resteraunt
2,"This place gets 5 stars for uniqueness and character. I've been here several times over the years and it's always lovely in the spring and the fall. The food is above average and fresh. Unfortunately, they get a 3 on service. The staff is downright rude and snippy when you ask them questions. Everything is self service and it's as if they don't want to be bothered.  Note to the business manager: please update your listing. It says you close at 4pm on Saturdays, but it's really 3pm.  We saw many people come to the door at 3:15 and they were locked. By 3:20, staff was turning the chairs upside down so we would get the hint. When I mentioned it to a staff member that the closing time on Yelp was incorrect he mumbled \""yah, we get that a lot\""."
4,"Delicious food in a beautiful setting.  We loved walking among the pecan trees, sipping lemonade and looking at the farm animals.  They even have a small produce market.  I had the pecan cinnamon brioche french toast - it was amazing!  The caramel sauce was decadent!  My husband really enjoyed his omelet."
4,The Morning Glory Cafe is absolutely gorgeous.  The food portions filled me up halfway through.
1,"Ahh yes, The Farm Kitchen at The Farm At South Mountain. I had it bookmarked to try for over a year. Finally got around to doing just that on Sat, May 3rd, 2014. I guess it was a bad omen when the BBQ place I wanted to take friends was already sold out and had been before noon that day.\n\nWhile they may serve good ingredients they sure do charge a premium for them. I spent just short of $22 (yep, half sandwich, cup of soup, drink and a small dessert, $22) for lunch and that was no tip included.\n\nWhy no tip you ask? Well other then having to make the sandwich I ordered and pour the soup into the cup you have to do everything yourself including clean up after yourself. TIPS really means: To Insure Prompt Service. There is no service here. Plus they gave me the wrong sandwich. So they got 50% of my order wrong.\n\n$22 for a self service lunch with baskets and plasticware. The sandwich was good and the soup just ok. This should have been at the very most, $10 to $12. I guess you have to pay for the ambiance of dining outside. Hey, it didn't cost them a dime to erect a building, insure it, air condition it, etc. All of the other expenses which might drive the cost up to $22.\n\nAnd honestly while it was nice to dine on a rickety old splinter infested wobbly picnic table under a tree, it wasn't like it was a nicely manicured golf course like lawn. I'm not sure why all you people are so WOW about this place. I'm never going back."
4,"First time at Farm at South Mountain. What a hidden gem!  Beautiful gardens, shops, restaurants and mini-community. \n\nOur table (all the tables) was set on a shaded patio with gorgeous views of the naturally-landscaped gardens. My wife ordered the American Breakfast, while I had the Morning Glory Spinach Benedict.  The drinks were self serve. \n\nOur meal arrived in five minutes. She got two eggs, sausage, skillet potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit. The eggs were cooked perfectly, along with the crisp/soft potatoes. My plate had toasted muffins, cooked spinach, loads of farm ham, poached eggs with loads of hollandaise, plus the same yummy potatoes. \n\nThe meal was excellent. A little pricey ($33 for the two meals and two drinks, plus tip) but absolutely worth it. The service was outstanding and the view: all five stars. \n\nThis was one of the best breakfasts I've had in my LIFE, considering the whole package. \n\nGet here!  They close for summer."
2,This place is really cute and relaxing. I really like the concept of the outdoor sitting and the open area. The sandwiches were good. The only thing was the price for everything. The price for a sandwich was a bit much. My husband and I both had a sandwich and soup and it was over 30 dollars. Also we ordered the potato soup and it had no flavor. I will give it another try for breakfast.
3,"Mobile Tip - Hope they hire an organized valet company next mother's day. \n\nReview - Now I've been to The Farm before, having eaten at Morning Glory with girlfriends on a saturday morning a while back.  It was a lovely experience (from the environment to the service - having asked for my \""any style\"" eggs to be hard boiled.  They didnt bat an eye at the request.) and I wanted to come back for Mother's Day with my family.   \n\nMother's Day - It's crowded.  I mean like WAY over 1+ hour wait for MG, crowded.  But that's understandable.  It was Mother's Day afterall.  If you want to come here for an event like the Mother's Day Brunch, reservations ARE required.  If you miss out on reservations for brunch, and decide to go to MG, go early!  \n\nWe decided to skip MG and were going to eat at The Farm Kitchen, but we ended up having to leave because Little C ended up having a major asthma attack.  We had used the valet service for parking, which offering valet on a busy day like Mother's Day is great.  BUT only if the service is organized.  We hustle back to the valet stand and I had over the ticket.  I look at the valet stand and there are key piled up everywhere.  No organization whatsoever.  They're digging for my keys, meanwhile Little C has just puked all over me for a 3rd time.  2 minutes go by and J and I ask them a couple times if they could please hurry and find our keys.  They find our keys and one kid runs off.  Next thing I know, the head guy (I'm guessing he was the guy in charge over valet), turns to us and says in a snarky manner...\""I'm SORRY your child is having issues.\""  \n\nUmm...excuse me?!  \n\nThank gawd they found the keys and got our vehicle up in a flash or else I would have had to not only call 911 for Little C's breathing, but for my putting my foot up that guys ass.   \n\nI think if we decide to come back, (which I'd like to go back because the atmosphere, service, and food at MG was great) we will self park across the street."
3,"I can't believe it took me 8+ years to pay a visit to the Farm. I was drawn in my a free jazz event they had one Saturday morning so a friend and I drove out for brunch. We got there before the concert started so we walked around and took in the grounds before grabbing something to eat from the cafe and lounging at a picnic table for awhile. I would definitely recommend a visit, whether you are looking for local goods, a nice meal, planning an event or check out their calendar of events."
1,"We had high expectations based on the Yelp reviews, but was disappointed on the overall conditions of the grounds around the two restaurants and the Maya farm.  The Maya firm was an actual pit, with weeds, mud, and huts in shambles. The chicken coop was in poor shape w/animals drinking out of green water. The Morning Glory cafe was good...great attentive service and the food was excellent. But, the amount of flies made it unbearable to eat, and sitting on those white plastic chairs wasn't that cool.  And, the grounds were just run down and really not ready for the public. A real gold mine, if the owners would invest in updating and cleaning up their property. Hopefully, they will."
4,An absolutely delicious brunch with honest food and eager to please staff. Youll definitely see me again.
1,"After being stood up by my studio photographer for the LAST time (a very angry yelp review is brewing in my head as I type this) I was getting dehydrated and gouchy as I haven't had a bite to eat all day. \n\nWe decided to go to La Olmeca for lunch. This place used to be one my auntie's favorites, so I chose to give it a go... We entered a booth filled resturant that seemed frozen in the 80s or worse - the early 90s. Wood paneled walls, grimy pastel booths and chipped wooden tables can be looked over when the food is good... but the food just wasn't.\n\nI had had the taco salad and was very disappointed. It was just meh. Taco Bell does a better jobat this lunch time favorite than these guys do. My mom got the cheese omlet special. She wasn't complaining, but I would be if I saw the brown underbelly of her overcooked omlet. Her potatos were straight from a bag. BUT the salsa was good. \n\nOverall... skip this place. Even if you're in the area... a couple blocks south and you'll be at Poncho's... trust me you'll be waaay better off! I don't think I'll ever go back."
2,"This place should be called Taco's Yum.  At least that was my thought after having some of their yummy yummy tacos.  I've had just about every kind now and while I can't say for sure that I have a favorite the carnitas and the fish are totally on top of the list. Mmmm.  Folks I've gone with have done plate food and burritos and both really liked what they've gotten.   Me, I stick to the tacos.  Yummy every single time.  Fresh veggies and herbs.  What's should be cold is cold and what should be warm is warm.  Juicy meat, but not so much so that it soaks totally through the corn tortillas.  I could go on, but really, I think the pictures of the tacos speak for themselves.  \n\nAnd did I mention it's cheap?  Sooooo cheap that I almost felt bad using my 2 for 1 coupon the first time I went.  Of course, I did anyhow.  And let me tell you that a free taco tastes just as good."
3,"I have eaten here a several times in the last couple weeks. Tried the shrimp el diablo and it was really good and so was the fillette empanizado.   They serve a small bowl of packaged type chips with salsa at the begining of the meal. The home made salsa they serve with the chips is really excellent, I asked and they let me buy some to go. This place has been here forever and continues to serve good food for a good price."
2,"Don't be afraid of the complex, it looks a little shady from the outside, to be honest it is not that nice inside either. However more often than not the hole in the wall joints turn in to hidden gems. This isn't exactly a gem, but it is cheap and good (say Los Favritos or La Salsa kind of  good).\n\nThe tacos are great and so are the tortas, the meat gets simmered for hours and the veggies are always cold and crisp. Ask for the extra hot salsa, it is smoky and spicy and wonderfully flavorful, I think it is chipotles en adobo but I can't confirm this. \n\nIf you happen to find yourself on the southside and are in the mood for fast, cheap mexican this is the spot to hit."
2,"It's been almost a year & a half since my last Update of La Olmeca here, so I stopped in this morning for breakfast to see how they're doing.\n\nLet's get the not-so-good out of the way first: \n\n*  The bathroom is awful!  It's painted up all crazy & stunk of Pine Sol.  Uck!\n\n*  I ordered Sausage & Eggs, over easy with sourdough toast, which the counter lady said they had.  My order showed up with white toast, & no butter or margarine!\n\n*  I had to ask for a water cup twice!\n\n*  I had to ask for pepper.  There wasn't any on any of the tables!\n\nOk, so 1 Star & we're out of here, right?  Well, not so fast, because:\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n*  The eggs, homestyle potatoes & sausage were all good.\n\n*  The sausage was three big 3\"" patties!\n\n*  The $5.49 price was very reasonable.\n\nNet, net, net???  Still 3 Stars!     :-)"
2,"= = = = = =  BUFFET DISCONTINUED  = = = = = =\n\nI'm still enjoying eating here, but the cafeteria style Weekend Breakfast Buffet had been discontinued, at least for the time being.     :-(\n\nWith that said, the food from the regular menu in this Mexican cafe is good, the portions generous, & it's inexpensive.  Yes, the place is dumpy, but they serve Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner, & I always enjoy whatever I order here.  They're nice people too, & they have beer.     :-)"
2,"Outdated look, slow service, half star for gud customer service... I think ud get ur food faster going thru drive thru, which ill happily take next time I come here :)"
4,Sister Sister  does amazing work.  And they are super fast at what they do.\nI recommend this place for braiding and weaves.
2,"I went out last saturday and had an good experience.  There was no bev. cart lady, the greens had been recently worked but for 20 bucks the price was right."
3,"Amazing course, With the highest value in the valley, the views and the course layout is close to perfect.  I rate this as a course that prides its self on the quality and humbles its self, it does not feel like you need to have a mililion dollars to play actually in the summer its under $14 with a cart!!\n\nDriving Range and one of the best Views of Phoenix from the South Side."
3,"A friend of mine invited me to play with him and some friends a few weeks ago.  I couldn't pass up the opportunity and made some time for golf.  For $47 per person, this was a great value.\n\nThe greens and fairways were in good condition and they didn't cram a lot of people onto the golf course, so the pace of play was just right.  There are some great views of Phoenix on certain holes.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n812L7Mz4104bQ5Goo7yQg?select=3xxxtMpGNa92_YOiw_iiYA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n812L7Mz4104bQ5Goo7yQg?select=yfSunO5v545PZhuraFLbFg\n\nThere's a menu board at the 9th hole tee box to order food to be ready at the turn, which is a huge convenience.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n812L7Mz4104bQ5Goo7yQg?select=s7_UPH3z_4TCSMB8xSBEyg\nAnother plus is that the beverage cart comes around often....:)\n\nFor the average golfer, this is a fun track.  Not sure it's challenging enough for the low handicap golfer.  Since I'm just an average golfer, I found it to be a good time.  The only knock is the location.....in the old Southern part of Phoenix near Baseline & 7th St.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%"
0,"Played this course today, course was in ok shape.  There is no sand in bunkers, but I guess if you don't it into them you shouldn't have to worry. There was no ranger on course at time s there was 3 foursomes on same hole led to 6 hour round.  If they are going to allow this slow pace make the cart girl work all day only saw her once on front side.  I do not recommend this course."
3,"This is a potentially great course that only suffers from the fact that it is way out of the way and lacks the pristine treatment of the $150 courses.  This course will eat you up, although it is not plagued by the Snottsdale niceties...no restaurant with $5 beers.  For the 7 handicap, try to shoot 75 without blaming the conditions.  And all for less than 30 bucks.  Suck it up."
4,"My son and I flew down from the Bay Area for two rounds of golf and a Giants Spring Training game.  In planning the 3 day trip, I found Vistal and decided to play our first round there.  We could have not been happier.  We were able to play as a twosome, and there weren't many people on the course, even on a Saturday, so our pace was very enjoyable. The course was in very good shape and was challenging enough for any level of golfer and has some fantastic views. The facility plays pop/rock music (not too loud) around the driving range and restaurant which was enjoyable. Driving range balls were included in the green fees.  The staff were fantastically friendly and accommodating. Value for the dollar was well worth it and we would definitely play Vistal again on a future visit."
2,"I was extremely disappointed with how dry this course is at the moment. Tee boxes are in good condition, fairways are dried out and greens are beyond dried out! Someone please water this course!!! \n\nThe layout of this course is so perfect! Greens are guarded by bunkers, some water hazards, and desert landscaping outside of the fairways. \n\nLast year at this time this course was in excellent shape with fairways with green grass and receptive greens. Hopefully this course gets it together soon!"
3,"$15 for summer rate?! \nGreat golf course. What you imagine about desert golf is here. \nJust bring lots of water or gatorade to stay hydrated. Maybe even a wet towel, ice and water to keep yourself cool."
1,"We were told this course was in great shape, then we arrive to notice after hole #1 that the course isn't even real grass. It's Bermuda grass which is far more difficult to shoot off of. Other than that it was pretty open and forgiving if you were to push one to the right our hook to the left. Also very confusing to drive on the cart paths if you have never played there before. They need much better signage."
1,"This place ok but clearly We need to come back when its busier cause the chicken was very dry, like its been siting for a while. The flavor was nice but the chicken killed it. Maybe if I got a full chicken it would be better but that was just too much chicken for one person. \n\nI got the 1/4 portion which is enough for 1 person and they give, rice, beans, tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, pickled onions and hot sauce. \n\nWhen you put everything together it tasted alright but it was just dry chicken."
3,"If there was a -$ rating for pricing- China Restaurant would get it.  The majority of the menu is  less than $5.  The fact that their food is so cheap actually makes me wonder about some things... but I try to avoid letting my mind wander.\n\nHonestly, their food is mediocre.  I had the house chicken which came with soup, a hefty plate of rice, chicken and an egg roll.  The chicken was a overcooked and drowned in too much sauce as a cover up.  The rice was cooked fine however, and I did enjoy the egg roll and soup.\n\nI went during lunch and they were very busy but the service was super fast. It is really a small space and they don't have much seating however there are a couple of large circular tables in the middle where they will sit anyone who needs a seat.  That's kind of cool to me.  I can imagine it's a good way to meet people that work around the area.\n\nThis place is a pushover into the four star realm for me.  If they were ever to raise their prices to be more expensive than McDonalds, it would turn into a 3. But no complaints for right now- if you need a cheap place to eat, this is on the top of my list."
3,"The quality of the food is 3 star, but the price makes it 4 star.\n\nThey usually have way too much sauce, but it's not too bad otherwise.  If you're looking for a huge lunch for less that $4, it really can't get much better than this.  By far not the best, but it'll do in a pinch and the price can't be beat."
1,Panda Express sounds good. I only gave them 2 stars because it was dirt cheap.
3,"Found China Restaurant (clever name don't ya think) end of last year when a friend took me there and have been going since then. I dig the community seating, it gives it a family feel. Plus I am a people person so it just forces conversation with people. Service is fast & you don't have to wait long for your food. Lunch time you can eat for under 5 bucks and come out feeling full. I have tried a few of their dishes, beef broccoli, mongolain beef, and pepper beef and asked them to make them extra spicy and they turn out great! Yea their dishes are heavy on the sauce but I find that the fried rice goes well with the sauce, the lunch combo comes with egg drop soup (I don't care for it, but not cuz of the place just not a fan of eggs) egg roll fried rice & meal all for under 5 bucks! Can't beat that! When you want a fast cheap lunch and not from a fast food joint, give China Restaurant a try!"
3,Can't beat the pricing/ plate. The food quality has been very good. Love the chicken wings.
1,"I don't know why I keep ordering Chicken Egg Foo Yong from this place.  Perhaps because the lunch special price is cheap at $4.92.\n\nHowever, there is so much sauce laden on the egg that you can't even taste it.  This is the 3rd time that I've had this dish and the 1st time was pretty decent, the last 2 times were terrible.  I don't know if they changed their cooks but if/when I come back, I will order something else.  The place gets packed at lunch so they have to be pretty decent."
3,"It's a beat up Chinese restaurant with good food and ridiculously low prices. A regular lunch spot for me, since it's near my office.  Service is very quick as they make every effort to get you out to make room for the next customer. Not the kind of place where you can lounge around as you will receive a look from the staff that clearly says it's  time to go. But the good food and great prices make the former easy to get past."
2,"Cheap and good for the price, lunch special includes fried rice, egg roll, soup and entree.  Will continue to ear here when working in the area"
2,"I'm reasonalby sure that Jack puts crack in those tacos.  99 cents for two tacos is crazy!  And yes, I know they are kind of greasy and they don't use the most amazing ingrediants but there is something about them.....\nMy other favorite item is the chicken fajita pita.  It's a great option if you don't want a burger.  The fries are decent and they have a nice variety of options to choose from. And I must admit Jack's commercials are funny. Thanks Jack!"
0,"This is the worst Jack in the Box around.  The customer service at this place is consistently terrible, to the point that I stopped going long ago.  Half the issue is having employees whose English is unintelligible.  If you can't understand English - which is the language of this land (last time I checked, anyway), how is a person reasonably expected to be able to correctly take an order?  One time I was there, I asked for 2 Jumbo Jacks, hold the mayo.  I had to repeat myself 4 times to the attendant before they finally understood.  When I got home, the burgers were slathered with mayonnaise.  \nAnother time I got 2 regular burgers instead of the sandwich I had ordered.\nAnother time, apparently it was a shift change and I stood there for several minutes, waiting for someone to help me. All of the employees were RIGHT there, completely ignoring customers at the counter.  \nThe last time I went, I again requested no mayo.  This time, however, when they handed me my bag full of food, I opened it up and laid it all out on the counter and then began opening each item (I was buying for 4 teenagers besides myself, I had a lot of food there).  My burgers were again slathered with mayo.  I called the manager of this store a couple of times hoping they might be able to get this place in order, but that dream never materialized.  I no longer go to this Jack in the Box and go to the one at 24th Street and Baseline instead (MUCH better service there with people that actually speak English!)."
0,"DO NOT RENT FROM THEM.  We were lucky to escape renting from this place and found a better alternative.  Our experience through the application process was TERRIBLE.  We were told it was a $300 deposit, then a $575 deposit, then a $150 deposit.  NO ONE IN THE OFFICE ever knew what they were talking about, which was astonishing since we spoke to a new staff member with every interaction.  They were the most unprofessional, unorganized, uneducated bunch that I have ever worked with in my entire life.  To top it off, they refused to return $100 fee (towards deposit) after their series of errors.  RENT FROM ANYWHERE BUT HERE."
0,"DO NOT RENT HERE OR EVEN APPLY.  This place KEEPS YOUR HOLDING DEPOSIT.... they do not tell you it is non-refundable!  CRIME is an issue.... 30 crimes in the last 90 days including MURDER, ASSAULT, BURGLARY and THEFT.  COCKROACHES are a big issue in this place according to residents I spoke with, as are SCORPIONS.  Now here is my story.... I applied to get an apartment here, but you have to income qualify; frankly it was the only place I could really afford.  Whether or not I qualified depended on how my employer filled out paperwork.  The paperwork went back and forth, but I never saw it.  As of Friday, 11/15/2013 I was told by my employer that the paperwork was with Marcus at the apartments; I had been calling that week to find out status. I called there 11/15/13 and was told Marcus was out of the office, and was the only one who could help me, and would be back next week.  At no point did anyone contact me and tell me if I even qualified.  I had explained when applying that I was homeless as of 11/16/13.  Today, 11/20/13 Marcus advises me they are still working on the application process, and that the employer sent back paperwork stating that I was approved.  I reminded him that I was homeless as of 11/16/13, and that efforts to contact him last week, and on 11/15/13 were all fruitless, that I did not even know if I qualified, and I had to go to and apply elsewhere.  I told him I need my holding deposit back, and he stated it was non-refundable.  I advised that it was a \""holding deposit\"", and AT NO POINT WAS I TOLD THAT THE HOLDING DEPOSIT WAS NON-REFUNDABLE.  He stated that they held the apartment too long, and I advised that again, it was a \""holding deposit\"", and that it was not my fault the apartment was held too long.   The apartment was not ready to be rented at the time I put down my deposit, I am certain, because I looked in the window and it was filled with appliances, and did not appear to have been cleaned yet.  I advised Marcus that I would be placing this review on Yelp, and would be calling the better business bureau.  I assume this is  not uncommon, because he simply did not care, but did state he would talk to his manager about it.  I will update this as I see what happens.\n\nWHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT EVEN APPLY HERE.  I KNOW INDIAN SPRINGS APARTMENTS ARE NOT THE BEST EITHER, BUT THEY ARE AFFORDABLE AND NEAR THE FIESTA MALL... GO THERE!"
4,"A lovely drive up and a fantastic city view from the top of the mountain.  Great hiking trails.  The visitors center is excellent and even offers a super-easy 1/4 mile \""hike\"" over flat ground to some real petroglyphs carved into the mountain rock a long long long time ago.  Great place to go exploring, to get away, and to bring out-of-towners!"
2,"Uh-oh. Where am I? \n\nThe view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. \n\nOk, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. \""Don't worry,\"" I told my friend. \""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street.\"" Oh, little did I know. \n\nLet me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. \n\nThe second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. \n\nWe parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. \""Onward!\"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. \n\nA little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us \""lost,\"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. \""Let's ask somebody,\"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, \""Will this trail loop back around?\"" \""Where do you want to go?\"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. \n\nWe pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.\n\nWe set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. \n\nHaving hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. \""Let's hitch a ride,\"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. \n\nThat's when a car slowed down. \""Ugh, creep,\"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, \""We can take him.\"" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. \n\nWe chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. \n\nThe kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. \n\nWe counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review."
3,"South Mountain is the place for a hiker to visit when he/she doesn't want to deal with the headaches and the mass of humanity that are Camelback and Piestawa.  Granted, there are reasons for their popularity, and no, South Mountain isn't really on their level as far as personal challenge or scenic masterpieces go, but its a very solid alternative for a weekend hike when you know that the line of cars for parking is stretched a mile long in central/north Phoenix.\n\nMy gf and I usually hike the Alta trail, which is a progressively steep trail up to the peak, but still a manageable grade in slope that you will never have to use your hands to ascend or descend.  It takes about an hour and 15 mins to go up and down the mountain, and the view of SoPho, Downtown, Glendale, and Tempe are killer.  Its a great place to snap a few pics of the enormous city below.  \n\nTypically, we will run into one or two hikers maximum on this hike, which pretty cool for some solitary reflection.  Lately, I've taken up bringing my iPod along, as there is nothing quite like descending the valley into the park amongst massive mountains with Band of Horses or The National narrating your steps musically.  Breath taking."
3,"What a great park. We really enjoyed this mountain area. This was both my boyfriend and my first time in the Phoenix area. We drove up to the summit and loved the views from the top. Neither of us had ever really experienced big cacti up close and personal and really enjoyed hiking around and looking at the beautiful scenery. Now, if we had only been able to find The Farm...we drove around forever looking for this restaurant area...oh well."
1,"The drive up the mountain was narrow and dizzying. Will never go back here again because after the twists and turns of the drive, that are sharp, by the way, I was so dizzy and sick to my stomach. I almost wanted to paraglide back down because I was dreading the drive down the mountain. Mt. Lemmon in Tucson is much better. The views weren't that great either at South Montain. Waste of time. The directions online were confusing too. The road that it tells you to turn on is closed!!!! It is free though, so that was the good part."
2,"After living in Flagstaff for 7 years, I guess I became somewhat of a snob of trails.  But it's kinda close to my house and the view is decent. Too many people for my style usually.  But I did do some trail maintenance on SM with VOAZ which was pretty cool.  See pic."
3,"The drive to the top is really fun, and the view is worth it.\n\nI really enjoyed it here, but there's too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas.\n\n30 other reviews = TLDR (i just learned that one, see how I'm applying) so I'd rather be brief and useful than wordy and redundant.\n\nI did read Chuck R's review, and I have to say, I wish I knew more of the nooks and crannys that you do, but I can tell you that if you want to explore the Western reaches of the park, do so by starting in the center or east, and not to bother with approaching from the West side of the mountain range itself.  All you'll find out there is a bunch of paranoid, possesive property owners who didn't stop to think that if they chose to own a home on a ribbon of private land that surrounds public land and restricts the public from getting to their public land, then they'll have to endure a little bit of traffic from said public.  Here's a clue for any of those property owners, whether you're on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesn't have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh."
3,"Drove to the top today and it was well worth it.  New to town so it was nice to get a \""bird's eye view\"" of our new city.\n\nDidn't hike it yet, since it's the middle of July and we don't want heat stroke- I think that will be a winter excursion.\n\nMust see!"
4,"If you do drive it, you can make it all the way to mcdowell coming down w/o hitting the gas once at night.\n\nSilent Sundays!  They shut the road down to cars so bring your skateboard/bike/radio flyer wagon and roll it.\n\nBRING WATER.  I never unserstood how people live in the desert and then end up stuck on a mountain dehydrated with heat stroke.  News flash, its hot and dry here.  Come prepared.   This mountain has probably the best views of the city and some really cool trails.  If you are gonna drive it make sure to fill your tank up because while it takes nothing to get down it youll go thru a half tank getting up it :)"
4,"I recently moved to South Phoenix and have explored a few of the SM trails with my dogs. I've found that the trails are very sparsely populated on week nights, but weekends bring tons of traffic. \n\nMormon trail has become my favorite, and I hike it 2 to 3 times a week. It's the most easily accessible trail (from Baseline, turn South on 24th street and it meanders to the trial's generous parking lot). The trail inclines right from the beginning, and there are very few flat parts. It's a GREAT cardio workout. The first several times I had to take a few breaks to catch my breath. It takes about 30 minutes (1 mile) to get to the part that loops to the National trail, which is where I turn around. There is usually a fair amount of traffic but everyone is super friendly. \n\nKiwanis trail is lovely (accessed via Central, followed signs). It's in a \""crack\"" between two hills, making it almost completely shaded, ideal in the summer. The shade also facilitates different plant life than on other trails. It ends with a \""staircase\"" that would be great training for hiking the Canyon. It leads to the road that goes up to the top of the mountain. If you cross the road, you connect with Telegraph pass on the left, or you can hike to the hut on the right. \n\nI did Holbert Trail on Silent Sunday (access via activity center). It was packed, and we were constantly passing unleashed dogs, unicyclists, large families leisurely strolling, etc. We hiked about an hour up and reached a lovely summit. The trail itself was beautiful and somewhat challenging, but I would not recommend on a weekend if serenity is what you seek. \n\nRanger trail is my favorite so far (access near Central/ mile marker 1). The views around sunset are amazing, and the switchbacks get your heart pumping, and really motivate you to see what's around the next corner. \n\nI walked Las Lomitas Loop (accessed where it intersected Ranger) for about an hour, and never found where it loops to. It was ok, lots of up and down rocky river banks, but doesn't vary much in elevation or go up the mountain (that I saw, anyway) so the views aren't as good as other trails. \n\nIn February I hiked Alta trail. My first attempt I made it about 45 minutes up and didn't feel well and turned around. My second attempt I was eager to hike the whole thing, which is 4.5 miles! Including the .5 mile walk from the parking lot and up the closed road to the trail head, it was ten miles total. The first part is kind of boring and barren, but once you get to the top you can see the city on one side and the res on the other side. The trail wanders up and down and up and winds around the mountain side. I was thankful that I brought plenty of water and my headlamp as I hiked out in the dark. I was super sore but also super proud at this accomplishment. \n\nAll of the trails are fairly well marked, well maintained, and often cross a road or two so it never feels remote (for a single woman, this is a benefit). \n\nVisit for maps and info: http://phoenix.gov/parks/hiksogud.html"
4,"This is the largest urban park. Moreover, that urban part is great because I am 10-30 minutes from three major trailhead areas. \n\nFor hiking I like many points of entry, one of my favorites is telegraph pass, this is on the south side of the mountain. A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway. There is a paved path that is about 1/2 a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right.\n\nTelegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs. At the top, there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail. If you head west, you can reach a great Ramada.\n\nFrom the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national, after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills, I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel, Follow this trail to reach fat man's pass, contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around, this meets back up with national trail. Many unique rock formations on this hike. \n\nFor shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views.\n\nFor Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it's great for a novice rider."
4,"A short and to the point review!\n\nAwesome park for Hiking, photo taking, driving up the mountain, sight seeing, taking someone on a date, adventures, biking!\nAlways something new to see, and explore. It's a huge park, and every time you go you can see something new. \n\nSome days it can get crowded, but that's because it's a great park. You should go at 7pm and drive to the top of the mountain and check out the view. It's beautiful."
3,"Another beautiful day, and another new-to-me hiking spot to love - the Alta Trail!  I have been on other trails in South Mountain Park (Mormon, National), and this one is now my favorite.\n\nThe first time my friend and I tried to get here, a most disappointing barrier and sign informed us that the access road to the trailhead is only open the first weekend of each month, 5am - 3pm.  Doh!  Fast forward a couple of weeks for the second attempt and trust me, it was worth waiting for!\n\nThe trail is well-maintained, and not crowded, either (bonus!).  The fairly challenging elevation gain (over 1,100' in the first mile - AAAAGH!) includes many switchbacks, and a few sections where I had to use my hands to get over some larger rocks.  Maybe these trails need height requirements, like at Disneyland...  The scrape/bruise I still have on my left shin proves that I should have spent less time \""sightseeing\"" and more time watching where I was going.  Oops...  I consider it a Badge of Honor.  \n\nAt the top, the reward was clearly obvious - outstanding views of the Phoenix skyline and the Estrella Mountains.  Note:  this is the part where you use the \""hey, let's take some photos\"" excuse to pause and catch your breath!\n\nMark your calendar - first weekend of the month... go!"
4,"I hike here nearly every weekend. It never gets boring. Summers are pretty hot, so plan to start early, like at 5am. Springtime is always gorgeous, the wildflowers and cactus are in full bloom and everything is green. \n\nLots of people hit the trails with their dogs, but if you take yours please bring bags to pick up after your pooch. Those who don't are LAME. Try to keep your dogs leashed also. I have a smaller dog but some people are terrified of any dog (I've run across a few of them) so please follow the leash laws. Bring water for your pets too - some friends of mine saw a puppy die one summer because the owner didn't bring any water.\n\nThere are lots of great trails here. The Mormon Loop is really popular. It winds around and has some good rigorous uphill  areas. The Ridgeline is great too but avoid it if you are afraid of heights. \n\nThere are different ways to access the park, so be sure to check it out online to pick the right one. (I tend to go there by way of 48th Street near the I10.)\n\nTips:\nDogs are allowed (but must be leashed)\n\nBring lots of water (for your pets too)\n\nBring an energy bar or two\n\nBring tweezers in case you accidentally step on or touch a cactus\n\nBring your cell phone\n\nBring a whistle in case you get injured or lost and need to direct people where to find you\n\nWear the right shoes! One time I saw a Brownie troop, some of them wearing flip-flops. There were about 45 mins in, looking miserable. Hiking boots, sturdy sneakers etc. are appropriate.\n\nWatch out for mountain-bikers. Stay on the right side of the trail.\n\nDon't litter!\n\nMore tips, including nude hiking (??!!) can be found here: \n\nhttp://www.abc-of-hiking.com/hiking-etiquette/hiking-etiquette.asp\n\nEnjoy and have fun!"
3,"Friday, I enjoyed a hike along the Holbert Trail to Dobbin's Lookout at the top of South Mountain. \n\nThe trail begins at the activity complex (all the ramadas when you make your first left turn immediately after entering the park on Central Avenue). I found it a little tricky to follow in the very beginning. I wound up walking along a sandy wash for a bit thinking \""this can't be right.\"" And, I was correct. But it could've been a rookie error - seems you just go straight from the trail head and ultimately veer to the left to stay on the trail. \n\nThe 2.5 mile hike is described as \""difficult - fairly steep and long\"" with long being the operative word. I think North Mountain and Shaw Butte are much more steep. \n\nDobbin's Lookout is the highest point on South Mountain accessible by trail. At 2,300 feet, the view is probably the most rewarding of the Valley hikes I've done and, the difficulty level was just challenging enough to still enjoy. \n\nInstead of thinking, \""Phew! I did it. I can cross this off the list.\"" I plan to be back!!"
4,"Love South Mountain Park. It is such a great place to get some exercise and enjoy AZ! I take my dog for a trail run about every other week and always seem to find a new trail to explore (that may be because the trails aren't marked very well, but I can always find my way back to the car). I have to say the maps at the trail heads are a bit washed out, so before the \""smart phone\"" I had a difficult time determining how far I had actually hiked. Now that I have the cardio trainer on my Droid I can see I was padding my workouts juuuuust a bit... :) \n\nTrails can vary from easy to intense, depending on how hard you push yourself. You can get a great workout or enjoy a nice stroll, makes it a great place to take out-of-towners. \n\nParking is good in the summer (of course) and decent in the spring and fall. Expect to walk a bit to the trail head, especially in the winter - but that is what you are there for! The only day I CONSISTENTLY have trouble parking is Superbowl Sunday... is Camelback Mountain closed on that day? :)"
4,"This is a great place to hike in the valley! There are so many different trails here that very in length and challenge. Yesterday, a friend of mine and I took advantage of the beautiful weather and went up an unmarked area of the mountain. It was pretty much straight up, and my legs still are hurting, but it was totaly worth it.  I honestly don't know where exactly we were, but when we reached summit there was an awesome rock formation at the top, and an excellent view of nearly the entire valley!"
3,"My favorite trail in South Mountain starts at the trail head just south of 24th st and Baseline.  It's the start of the Mormon Loop and when you connect up to the Mormon Trail/National Trail it extends the hike to about 4 or so miles.  Or at least that's what I have been telling myself.  First part is stair master-esque, then descends very gradually (perfect place to add a run into your hike), then ascends again (catch your breathe) and then gets a bit boulder-y and you can either straight up hike this or run.  If you want, you can take the offshoot to Hidden Valley and Fat Man's Pass.  I wasn't too impressed with either, but it is definitely worth a view and will spit you back out onto the National Trail."
1,"So this is a 2.5 star review kids. Great parking, great hike, great view, friendly people. BUT COME ON! the trail signage is pretty bad and inaccurate. My friend and I are decently experienced hikers and we got lost twice. A 3-5 mile hike turned into 7 miles."
3,"South Mountain is one of the most popular areas for mountain bikers and hiking enthusiasts.  Some of the views on some trails are spectacular as you can see a good view of the valley from a horizontal perspective.  There are several trails and can be lost easily.  I suggest going with a friend who knows the trails or looking up a map ahead of time.  There are a few different entrance from Baseline Rd.  I would suggest going south on 46th street from Baseline.  There isn't as many people, so parking should be easy.  If you take this route, go through the Javelina trail, which will then lead you to the Ridge Trail.  The Ridge Trail has minor elevation gain, but it is great for your heart.  You will go left onto the Beverly Canyon trail which will lead you back to the parking lot.  This is about a 3.5 mile hike that will take anywhere from 1.5 to 2 hours.  The hike isn't as intense as Camelback, so you may not a Camelback backpack, but water bottle or Gatorade bottle should suffice."
4,We did the Mormon loop at South Mountain. Great easy hike with a great view at the end! Roughly 3ish miles round trip. Free parallel parking along the side of the road. \n\nPick up a map at the beginning of the hike and bring water!
4,"I've done everything from mountain biking, to short hikes, to all day hikes in South Mountain. And first let me say that I feel that I've yet to really get into even a fraction of what South Mountain has to offer.\n\nFirst off, the BEST place to get information on South Mountain is at HikeArizona.com. For SM specifically, go here http://hikearizona.com/traildex.php?ID=34&sRID=52&SHOW=YES\n\nI've done all or parts of the Mormon Loop, Guadalupe Ridgeline, Desert Classic, Pima East Loop, Pima West Loop, Javalina, Dirt Road, National, Geronimo, and Telegraph Pass. In other words, I've been on many of the eastern trails but haven't even touched the western trails. I need to get on that!\n\nWith that said, these ARE shared trails. You very well may encounter mountain bikers on these trails. Some of them are VERY inconsider it and go racing down and run over everything. If I remember correctly, a lot of people consider SM as a mecca of mountain biking and some even train for competitive mountain biking here. And from my experience, it is pretty good for mountain biking... even though I suck at it.\n\nWith that said, I am more of a hiker. I enjoy getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city and mountain bikers nearly riding by and clipping your ankle can be a bit bleh of this mountain. I want peace and quiet, yo! So I am going to say this... if you're looking for solitude, you may not find it here - especially when the weather is nice and on the weekends. If you want solitude, you'd be better off in the White Tank Mountains, especially if you can muster a 14mile trip... or the Superstitions. Neither of those places have I ever encountered mountain bikers (The White Tanks actually has a designated area for bikes). Likewise, Piestawa and Camelback mountains are always packed with people.\n\nSo, know your goal. If it just for exercise, the South Mountain is one of my favorite, partially because it is close to my house. If I want no people then it is Superstitions or White Tanks.\n\nThis should go without saying, but bring water. Let me correct myself, bring more water than you think you'll ever need. Arizona is notorious for dehydrating people. I personally bring a Camelbak 3L (100oz) filled completely up with water. I also bring a few flashlights/headlamps just in case I find the sun setting on me when I'm still out there.\n\nWhich reminds me... I've done numerous night hikes with the moon on SM. I actually didn't need a night except a few times where I wanted to make sure of my footing. So, if you aren't afraid of the dark... I highly suggest going hiking at night! It also gives a WONDERFUL view of the big sprawling city we call home - Phoenix. It's view off the National and Geronimo is supa-dupa awesome.\n\nWith that said, I give this trail a 5 star only because I think it offers so much and has a lot of diversity. It's not a trail system that you get into and go \""oh ****\"" a mile in and have to turn back. There are so many options to match your skill level and desired activity that it almost seems ridiculous. It may take a few times going to get a trail route figured out that you like (right amount of people, no bikes, good views, etc.) but once you do then it is golden.\n\nOn an impersonal note, parking can be busy during peak times. And, the gates close at sunset. You can still drive out after dark though. Park is dog friendly but please pack out what you pack in (I'm talking about dog poop here).\n\nEnjoy and see you out on the trail!"
4,"I can't add much to what has already been said....BUT I'll try, haha!\n\nUm, don't come here without a map, or some sort of gps device (NOTE: some spots in the mountain do not get good reception, so a map on your phone may not always fully come in). It is VERY easy to get lost!\n\nThere are many trails, I look forward to getting to know them better. So far, all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Loop.....Fat Man's pass is probably my most favorite spot...OH! AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there (including a natural tunnel) look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom!\n\nThis is a good area to do a hike in the dark....but don't do it until you've done the trail a couple times in daylight. You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there! If you do the night hike, make sure the moon is full.....you can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights. Plus, it's GORGEOUS! (if you did mormon trail at night, you could start about an hour before sunset, then head back as the sun goes down)\n\nDon't forget water, it is a moderate level hike.....and flashlights would be a good idea too, just in case :)"
3,Good park to hike in
2,"I love South Mt. So why three stars? I'll tell you why. Because recently our bonehead government decided to start charging $6 per vehicle when it used to be free. Do any government officials have a clue that it was already getting harder and harder to drive to South Mt. on account of the gas prices? Do they have a clue that it's possible to work your ass off and still be bored out of your skull come the weekend because there's no money left over after the bills? Of course not. \n\nThat being said, I loved it when it was free. The Kiwanis Trail offers glimpses of petroglyphs carved by the Hohokam. The trail going up to Dobbin's Lookout is scenic. One time I was hanging out at a ramada when a coral snake slitthered happily past me, like hi ya, I'm just chillin'. Another time, I drove my husband up to the Lookout and he was freaked out about the height. Another time I took my red tabby to Scorpion Gulch for some photos. My cousin-in-law was conceived at Dobbin's Lookout. For some of you, it would make a good baby making place. \n\nIn Phoenix's efforts to be touristy and environmentally friendly, they have started a ridiculous schedule where the fourth Sunday of each month, they close all vehicle access and all the marathoners crowd the place. San Juan Rd., which leads to the National Trail, is only open the first Sat and Sun of each month. Check the website schedule before you get disappointed."
2,Good for a low intensity hike...
3,"The view from the top is quite amazing! I took my fiancee up here for a sunrise as part of her proposal, and she loved it!! You really can see the whole valley. As you're driving around Phoenix and have an unobstructed view to the south, you should be able to see all of the radio antennas at the top. You'd be surprised how high you are when you finally up get there. The rangers up there are friendly too. Just as some of the other reviews state though, do WATCH OUT for random bike riders, runners, and various pedestrians on your way up and in. The roads are a little narrow and there is not much room for error."
3,"As a Phoenician I sometimes forget that we're lucky to have nature trails in the midst of the urban sprawl of this desert city. We may not have a memorable downtown skyline but something Phoenix does have a lot of are mountains that serve as a backdrop of gorgeous scenery. We are blessed to have many mountains with trails in each \""park\"" like North Mountain, the Mcdowell's, the Estrella's, Camelback, and the Grand Dame of Phoenix, South Mountain. This range or urban park which is considered the world's largest serves as a visual landmark to many. During the day, coming from downtown and head down Central Ave, South Mountain towers majestically over this metropolis and at night, the glimmering red lights of the tv/radio towers that sit at its summit just sparkle. It provides direction, and this natural backdrop can also lay claim to being a memorable Phoenix landmark. But apart from its visual beauty this urban park provides an active recreation outlet to residents of metro Phoenix for it has many different trailheads at various points from Ahwatukee to Laveen. I liken South Mountain to be like Runyon Canyon in Hollywood, but here we have far more trails and it ranges from the easy to the difficult. And like Runyon Canyon you can drive up South Mountain and look below and see the grand expanse of sprawl glowing under the night sky and just take it all in. Yes, we are lucky to have this, literally in our backyard."
4,"Not from Phoenix and I was only here for the weekend but man, some of the best hiking I have ever done.  There is always Camelback Mountain and Piestewa Peak but these 2 are usually crowded and offer few ways but one to get to the top.  South Mountain has a ton of trails that intersect and crisscross so you can always visit many awesome views and peaks.  It is possible to drive up to the top but you can access trails from many areas.  I tried the Ranger Trail and National and several others and they ranged from a steep walk to difficult so it offers variety.\n\nIt is usually hot (specially when you visit from the Midwest) so bring water!  I was drenched in sweat by the end but it was so worth it.  You will feel like you worked out enough to enjoy the next three meals.  Because I did."
2,"They need a seperate cyclist trail or ban the 10 speeds from flying down the road.  They are more dangerous than the cars with no regard for vehicles or pedestrians.  Went up to the observation area.  Of course there are people hocking jewelry, their kids tearing up anything that will come loose and elders sitting in the shade, drinking from paper bags. \n\nThe view is nice, and trails are great for exercise. People suck"
3,"The best thing about South Mountain is the location. It's nice to get out and about without having to drive more than a couple minutes.  There are really long hikes if you are so inclined. As well as lots of short ones that can be done without a whole lot of planning or worry.  Always print out the map it's pretty easy to get turned around as there are a lot of convergent trail heads in some places.  There are always people on one or all of the trails either hiking or mountain biking on the north east sides of the park. So if you are looking for a solitary lone hiking experience this is not the best place.  There are several entrance and parking points so there is never really a problem parking.  The 24th street / Baseline entrance has a pretty steep hike up to get to the Mormon Loop which is pretty cool. The 48th Street entrance has pretty good parking and is close by as well.  There are some pretty good views of the city and surrounding areas, but you don't ever feel all that remote and on your own as you would in places farther out.   I haven't tried any hikes on the far south side yet, but I'll update when I do."
4,"South Mountain Park is a great place to bring out of town guest.  The reason why I say that is because the view is outstanding.   It is a nice 20 minute drive up the mountain to Dobbins Point.  We came up to Dobbins Point on Saturday with family and it was incredible view when it is clear outside.   Also I found out that this park is the biggest park in the world.  \n\nIf you ever have family or friends in town and want to go for a hiking or just want to see an awesome view of phoenix, you should bring them here.  \n\nHappy Yelping.  :)"
4,"It's hard not to give 5 stars to Mother Nature! Wonderful views from practically anywhere, whether it be the Valley of the Sun or one of the many canyons tucked away inside the mountain. With a wide variety of trails, some that you can ride a horse on or mountain bike through, and of course the occasional picnic area, South Mountain has a lot to offer.\n\nI had family from Nashville in town for the weekend, so I was racking my brain on what to do with them that's a unique Arizona experience...there's a lot that the Valley has to offer, but since they are active people, South Mountain was called upon.\n\nWe took the Mormon Trail then connected to the Mormon Loop to get to the top. The trail was about 2-2.5 miles total, and while it got steep in some sections it was a good 'starter' trail for someone looking for a mild challenge and a relatively quick ascent. Being the tourists they are, my family frequently stopped to take pictures of the mountain and city, and by golly did they love every minute of our hike! Personally, since I live ten minutes from the mountain this was not my first South Mountain rodeo, but I have yet to be disappointed."
4,"I like this palce since it's so accessible. You don't have to hike all the way up, even though you can and people do. But I always drive up and the drive is a relaxing winding mountain road that has great views of the valley. It's right in the middle of the city so it's very accessible. Sunset is absolutely beautiful here and I'm sure it's the makeout point type of destination lol. But yeah people are always taking sunset pics up here and my dog loves the trip."
3,"Great trails... A lot of bikers...  I have been running on south mountain now for years.  I like the part of south mountain that is in Ahwatukee.  I usually park by warpaint and then run from warpaint all the way down desert classic.  The trail is clean and offers trails that are easier and more challenging.  It's very peaceful and you can get lost (in a good way).  The only downfall, it is very rocky, so when you're running, watch out for rocks or else you'll have an accident like I did last week!  Try out south mountain, you will enjoy all of the hiking and nature and it's close to everything in the valley."
2,"It's a beautiful place.  There are tons of hiking / biking trails, and there are a couple of roads that provide access to some fantastic views.  If you're into hiking, check this place out.  \n\nMany years ago, people with off highway vehicles could participate in off road activities here.  They no longer allow that.  I am, in general, not a fan of the city, state or federal government limiting or restricting access to responsible OHV users, so therefore I am giving this 3 stars.   I have a Jeep that I've put a lot of time and effort into making capable to handle serious off road use, and it's disappointing that I have to go an hour or more outside of the valley to do so when South Mountain is so close by.  Plus it totally makes sense that you can't drive off road here because it's a \""preserve\"", yet at some point, parts of the park will be completely destroyed when the 202 comes through (sarcasm)."
1,The grand canyon is a wonderful place. But it gets boring fast.
0,"The National used to be one of the very best mountain biking trails around unfortunately the rangers have been demolishing the natural obstacles, smoothing out the trail, I call it de-naturalizing.\n\n\""They paved paradise and put up a parking lot\""."
4,"If you lived in Phoenix, your visiting, or your just strolling by I would check out South Mountain. They have hiking trails for just about anyone (Beginner's or not.) \n\nThe view if you take your car up to the top is still very good. You can start to see that pollution has taken a toll on the clarity, but it is not Los Angeles yet even though I believe we are well on our way. Unfortunately.  Take your kids before your not able to see the whole city."
3,"I can't believe we'd never been here.  We enjoyed the drive, the walks, the views and the shelters.  I little difficult for our elderly father but he still enjoyed it.  The path to the benches was rough but we made it assisting him on his walker."
2,Recommended from on of my boy friends to go for a visit to LA river with them I went there and saw the river here. This visit was enjoyable though a little tough for me as it was through bicycle. But I found nothing else except river's scenic beauty. Sometimes a little more adds by the blowing air.
3,"South Mountain Park is a great place to take visitors who have never been in the valley before - the views are running stunning. Most of the tails are okay at best - especially towards the trailheads. Close to the trailheads, there's not a lot in the wy of views or wildlife, and there tend to be a lot of people. If you travel in far, however, there's a lot more activity - endangered species, petroglyphs, old mining housing, even some rock-climbing."
4,"I live a short bike ride away from one of the many trailheads at South Mountain. I will not reveal my favorite hikes, as they are usually empty of people and I am selfish and want to keep them empty. There is something very cool and Quentin Tarentino-esque about walking down an empty paved road into the sunset.\n\nSouth Mountain is part of the Maricopa Trail (it is the National Trail in the Park) that is going to ultimately circle the entire Phoenix Metro area. When the South Mountain Freeway (the 101) is completed, the western tip of the Mountain park will be changed for the highway. This makes me sad."
4,"As a tourist in town for a wedding we had a day to spend and decided to go hiking and enjoy the hills and views. We floundered a bit around the park but then went to the rangers station and asked for a trail recommendation. She discussed a couple of options with us accessing our fitness level (medium) and time limits (2-4 hours) and suggested the Holbert Trail to Dobbin's Lookout. It's 3.9 miles from where we started to the top. At the top you are treated to a view of the entire Phoenix valley. Your sense of accomplishment is really great because you will find yourself at the pinnacle of a mountain that you can see from all over, point to and tell your friends \""we went to the top of that one today\"" and they will be impressed. The ranger did good and we had a great experience. Seek out a ranger."
4,"Amazing views with many trails.  This is a great place to get some exercise and experience the beautiful desert landscape.  The trails seem to vary from easy to more difficult, so a nice variety depending upon your ability and interest.  This place gets very busy on the weekends but there are quite a few different areas to find parking.  There are picnic tables throughout the park as well."
0,"A business built on lies. I showed up at 7:10p on a Friday. The sign outside of the building said they were open until 8p. Their website said they were open until 7:30p. However, the door was locked. All lights and TV were on. So I knocked on the door. As I was knocking, a woman peaked out of one of the windows.  When I saw her, she quickly ducked down. I proceeded to knock. Some guy eventually came to the door. He didn't even unlock it and yelled at me through the glass they were closed. I questioned him on it.  He replied \""read the hours on the door.\"" The door only had the time they opened. I referenced the sign outside and the website. According to both, they should have still been open. He stamped and lied saying the hours had changed. Probably a blessing in disguise, since they went to such great lengths to avoid my business (hiding & lying), I can only imagine the low quality of care."
0,Rude receptionist ..does not know about  co-pay..spent 10 mins double checking with Blue Cross ..as many others ..could not help me..wasted 50 bucks...And whats up with the Doctors dog in the lobby..Could not hear Doc explaining results with dog barking!!!
3,"Pretty sure this is not closed, since I go here all the time. I am a big fan of the Pharmacy and the Pharmacist (Brian) is a very cool guy, knows his stuff, and gets things done! Overall I would give the Pharmacy 2 Thumbs Up!"
3,"I made some purchases here for my nonprofit group.  I was able to get some gel deoderant with some coupons from the Sunday paper and coupons from the store. \nMy final purchase was 12 sticks of deoderant for $21.  I made the purchases over several times and at different stores because I am learning how the coupons work.  I believe I scored with the price, and it will definitely help my group.  The cashier was helpful, after I told her what I was doing.  She didn't fully understand the coupons, but she tried.  I plan on going back to see what more I can get for my nonprofit group. \nThey can have some good deals, you just have to look for them."
3,"Good location, friendly staff, easy access.  In and out in under 5 minutes."
2,"I like to come here because it's locally owned and it's a lot easier to get help than it is in Home Depot, but a couple of summer's ago it was really, really hot in the store.  When I was paying I asked the cashier guy if the AC was broken and he told me that the owner liked to make a game of how low he could keep his electricity bill.  Surely that month he hit an all time low.  It was August and I could swear it was cooler outside.  That's all besides the point though.  I really like that they have loose screws and nails and that they cut keys and they have the pretty keys with flames painted on them.  To top it off, the toddler just discovered they have toddler sized shopping carts there.  Something for everyone."
3,"Fast friendly and lots of hard to find items (Flashlight bulbs, nuts, screws, etc.) I usually go to Lowes or Home Depot for stuff, but sometimes they have great deals. Defiantly not my go to store, kind of like Radio Shack...It is a specific visit."
2,"Ace is a great place to go when you are working on little projects aound the house. They cater to homeowners, not contractors. The staff are friendly and always willing to help. Even though it is further from my house than Lowe's or Home Depot, I can get in and out of Ace much faster. The main reason I go here is because they carry Benjamin Moore paint, which I think is a higher quality than the big box store brands."
4,"I'm a grandma, and that affects this review.  I live about 40 minutes away from this Ace, but am often in the area to babysit grandkids. I find the staff very helpful and understanding when I've gone there with my grandkids.  About a month ago, I had all 3- ages 7, 5, 4.  I had prepped them on proper behavior when in the store, and when we walked in, there was a big M&M display that wowed them.  They were  excitedly noisy, and when an older male employee walked over to them, I thought he was going to admonish them; instead, he engaged them in a conversation about favorite kinds of M&Ms.  Nice.  Then, the female cashier invited them to the counter and let them choose some lollipops from a bag she pulled from behind the counter.  \nThen today I went there with just the 5 year old grandson who was wearing a plastic fireman's helmet.  A young male employee came up to us right away, asked if I needed help, and  took me right to the curtain rods.  An older male employee stopped  and said, \""Hey, we need to salute the fire chief.\""  They both saluted my grandson who returned the salute.  Doubly nice.   \nI asked my son if he shops there and he said that if he needs something quick and knows exactly what he needs, Ace is the place.  I really appreciate the helpful attitude I've encountered.\nAnother note: I frequently buy online, mainly from Amazon.  When I was writing this review, it occurred to me to look at Amazon for the tension curtain rods that I bought at Ace today.  I do not know if they are the same brand, but Ace's price was about $2 less than Amazon."
4,"I Love this Ace location!\n\nI have been here a few times, and every time I have been here I have been greeted by a friendly rep, always gotten help when needed, and everyone seemed very genuine and happy to be there. \n\nThey also are a larger location, so there is an excellent inventory and selection. Plus, ACE is a much more personable experience than going to Home Depot, Lowes, etc. I definitely recommend it!"
0,"My advice is DO NOT live by the basketball courts or in the \""A\"" buildings (even though it's the cheapest area and there is a reason why it's cheap). I have lived here for almost ten months and all I can say is \""HOLLY CRAP\"" there is a lot of freakin kids. My neighbors love to smoke pot and it sucks for people who don't smoke. Kids are always crying in the middle of the night and running up and down the stairs. Teenagers are walking around in the middle of the night being loud. There was a car with a busted window so, don't leave anything valuable in the car. My neighbors down stairs are always fighting and I can hear the wife crying. If you need to sleep in the day time, FORGET about sleeping if you live in those apartments...  When we 1st saw the place they took us to the north part of the apartment which is nice and peaceful. They then told us we were in the \""A\"" building which turned out to be a freakin zoo! Kids are everywhere with no adult supervision and the children love to play chicken with the cars! We almost hit some kids playing that game and we get paranoid when we come home. So... cheap apartment = ghetto and headaches. Pay extra money for a better place so you don't have to worry about your car nor your sanity."
0,"I have lived in the valley for 7+ years as a college student, and I have lived in 5 separate apartment complexes and one rental house and I can say that these are the WORST apartment complexes I have ever lived in.  \n\nJust as heads up I live in the North side of the apartments, and while we have less children over here, we have more teenagers that lurk in the shadows at night. (Seriously).\n\nA huge issue I have is the fact that randomly the outdoor apartment lights and parking lights will be off 2-3 nights out of the month, so if you want to come home late and feel safe, NOT going to happen.  I NEVER feel safe here.  Plus, I just had a neighbor come over the other day (while cracked out) and ask me for $10.  I've never met the dude, I always see him in his house (no job), just a freeloader.  This is the quality neighbor you will reside nearby. \n\nAlso, EVERYONE here smokes marijuana, EXCEPT my boyfriend and I, and the one security guard that I know lives here.  It smells like weed CONSTANTLY.  From elderly people smoking medical, down to teens, it's absurd. Plus, it says in the lease that they have a no tolerance policy when it comes to illicit drugs. Joke. I'll bet you that there are MULTIPLE drug dealers that live in this complex, if not a grow house/kitchen/what have you.  \n\nRight now it is March 2012, and they have had the pool closed for like 2-3 months, no explanation, nothing.  Fine, not like I really want to go swimming in a freezing pool.  They also have a free (dumb) work-out area that they give free (dumb) keys to all of the residents.  Tip: Make the key cost a ($50) deposit so that I don't see children playing in there, and then make legit people like myself have to pull pens out of the weight machines because cheap b**tards cant afford a $7 pin at Play-it-Again Sports. BAH!!!! \n\nI work out enough to have to deal with this crap regularly, AND NOW in addition to the pool being closed, I just found out (at 8:00pm at night, with the pool chained (classy) and no lights on around my door) THAT THEY JUST CHANGED THE LOCKS TO THE WORK OUT AREA. THANK YOU FOR THE HEADS UP PRESIDIO!!!\n\nP.S.Presidio: Stop wasting your money on a free DVD rental checkout system at the front desk because it's trashy.  Also, when a CURRENT RESIDENT comes to get a package and has to wait 30 PLUS MINUTES to receive said package because your bimbo employees cannot make the prospective residents wait ONE MINUTE while you get our package is appalling. \n\nP.S.S. Don't hire imbeciles who are afraid of dogs when you are one of 2-3 apartments in the entirety of Ahwatukee who allow large sized dogs. \n\nIn summation, I would LEGITIMATELY never wish that anyone ever live here ever.  Oh I forgot, we've already had issues with EVERY appliance in the apartment because they're 7-10+ years old. Good luck!"
0,"This place was the most disgusting and unorganized place I ever lived!  Yeah, parking spaces are super tiny, apartments smell like crap, the front office is so disorganized and rude, and my neighbors were always having parties and even running around naked!!  (It appeared to be a dare kind of a thing.)  Plus, people don't pick up after their dogs like they should - - one lady would walk her dog over to the yard by my building, let it take a dump, and then walk it back over to where she lived.  So disgusting!!!  The front office has ZERO idea what is going on and what they need to do.  I tried taking my complaints to the corporate office, with no avail!  It was horrible!  I couldn't wait to get out of there!"
0,I would not even give you people a star. You all are hopeless!!! From the ladies at the front desk to the guy who cant speak english and cant fix a simple molding because i ended up redoing it myself. I can not believe someone lets this place run like this. I have nothing against mexicans but its funny how much different im treated because im white. Little did you guys know i can understand alot and may end up leaving before you guys even know. You wouldnt know till the 8th of the month to come check anyway.
1,"I will attempt to give a fair review. Most of the reviews on here are a little dramatic. I lived in a 1 bedroom 1 bath on the Wakial Loop side on the 3rd floor for 1 year and 3 months, while I searched for a house. \n\nThe front staff was friendly, but before signing anything, realize that they do \""fudge\"" certain facts. Your water bill changes every month and it is a ridiculous amount. I was told my bill would not be more than $30 in any given month for water, I consistantly paid $40-50 each month, even during the winter. Currently I pay $50/month for my house water, sewer, and trash combined. Not sure how I ended up paying $50/month for water alone in a small one bedroom apartment. I paid my rent on time each and every time and had no problems there. For people who complain about that, if you just paid your rent on time then you wouldn't have any issues about late fees. Read the contract you sign.\n\nThe apartment was clean when I moved in and in very livable condition. The A/C unit was leaking on day 1, but I called and they immedietly came and fixed it the next day (a Sunday). I only had to call maintenace 3 times while staying there. Twice they were very quick to respond. The 3rd time it took over 2 weeks to get someone to fix my only bathroom sink.\n\nAs other have mentioned, parking is horrible. The spaces are small and you have to hope you get luck and you have a compact with two neighbors that have compacts. Other than that, nothing else will fit. I have a SUV and was able to work with the front office to get another parking spot that was larger. It was weird how different spots were different sizes.\n\nFor the most part I had decent neighbors on 2 out of 4 sides. My neighbors across the hall and below me were horrible. However, this is not fair to the apartment as idiots will do whatever they want regardless of what they are told. My neighbors across from me were always running up and down the stairs and yelling and screaming (kids). The neighbors below me would play loud annoying music late into the night and made it impossible to sleep. After a week of this, they stopped (I'm assuming the front office did something about it.)\n\nThe gym as decent, a few machines and treadmills, however the annoying thing was that kids would come in and trash the place and take the pins for the machines. This made it difficult to use the machines and you would always find pens in place of pins. The pool area was difficult to get into and out of. They don't give you a key for it, but it just opens in the morning and closes at night. However if you're in the pool during the day and the door closes, good luck getting out. You'll have to climb over the gate or wait until a maintenance man with a key walks by.\n\nNow to be fair to the apt and the staff. Everything they did was fine, their service was OK, NOT great or exceptional but average and standard. Sometimes they were rude but they are consistantly very busy. You can't control the peoople who move in/out of the place so I don't think it's fair to judge the apartment based on the neighbors, but it is a factor whether you want to live there or not. It is a very good price and in an excellent area. It is close to the freeway and shopping and in a very safe area of town, thus you get all types of people who live there whethere they belong there or not. My neighbors had 6 people living in a 2 bedroom.\n\nAll in all, the experience was okay. I would not recomment ths place to live due to the neighbors and all the different types of people that live there. However it's not horrible and I felt safe and the staff tried their best to make the stay as good as possible."
0,"Do not live here! I currently rent here. It's pretty cheap, compared to other places nearby, but that's for good reason. I moved in around the middle of July and have placed a maintenance request at least once every other week. The apartment is full of very out-of-date appliances that break often, and the maintenance crew is not very good at getting to requests in a timely manner. The staff is not very nice, as a whole. I mainly speak with one woman on staff, and she is wonderful. However, I went to get a package tonight from the main office, which closes at 6pm. It was 6:10 when I got there and I knocked on the locked door, just to see if someone was still around and could quickly grab the little box from the back room. A woman I'd never spoken with opened the door, and very rudely and condescendingly told me that they were closed. I told her I was only looking to pick up my package from the room right over there, and she, very rudely again, told me that they were closed and that \""you can get it tomorrow.\"" She kept repeating, as if I were a child who didn't understand English, that I could come back in the morning. \nI'd think that, considering they know that people don't like this complex, they'd at least try to be helpful."
0,"By far the worst complex I have ever lived in! \nThis complex may seem beautiful on the outside but the inside and management is nearly a wreck! Kelsey in the front office is the only one who seems to be able to get things done. I moved in a few weeks ago to a two bedroom apartment with 3 working outlets, a broken oven, broken dishwasher and several cosmetic blemishes.  I've been requesting someone to come out and do repairs since move in and have been experiencing nothing but problems. I would never recommend this place to any family or friend. I ignored the other negative reviews at move in only because I was told it was due to old management that is no longer there... WRONG.. THIS PLACE IS STILL HORRIBLE.  Don't be an idiot like me, go elsewhere."
1,"I found Advanced while surfing checkin offers. They have a coupon for a discounted oil change, so I gave them a shot. The customer service is great, I walked in the door and was greeted by a very pleasant service writer. I showed the yelp offer, and they took the keys. Everything was going smooth so far... \n\nThey came back with a repair order for nearly 800; shocks, battery, 60k service, etc. I expected a few maintenance issues, but this caught me off guard. The friendly writer turned consultative and told me my battery must be replaced ASAP, I declined and went on my way. I decided to pit stop autozone and grab an airfilter when I noticed a \""free battery test\"" sign in the window. I got it checked out, and their test said my battery was 100% & manufactured 5/10. \n\nTrust your instincts during the up-sell.\n\n+2 stars for customer service & a checkin offer. -3 for the latter."
0,"I have a similar story about Advanced Auto Service.\n\nWent in for a routine oil change and came back with a repair order of over $3000 based on the steering. New rack and pinion, shocks, the works.\n\nI politely declined and went to get a second estimate elsewhere. I didn't show this second autoshop the quote Advanced Auto gave me. He asked whether I was there because I've been quoted repairs, and showed him the quote. He laughed at it. My car needed none of the repairs I'd been quoted on.\n\nHe even guessed which auto shop had quoted me before I showed him it was from Advanced Auto Service on Warner street. So my advice is be careful."
0,My car was overheating and I went there on a referral from my manager because I was clueless on where to take it and it was right down the street from my work. They were really nice and got me in fast but after I received the call that it was going to be $1250 before my brakes I was shocked. I called a friend to tell them and he said that I should really call around before spending that kind of money. I called Tempe Auto and Sun Devil Auto. They both gave me the same quote of $680 plus tax. I WAS SHOCKED!!! I could not believe that they were $500 less then what Advanced Auto was trying to charge me. I called back to let them know that I was going to take it somewhere else and when I told them where I was taking it they laughed. I ended up taking it to Sun Devil Auto which I dealt with a guy named Rolly and he was super nice and helped me with everything. DO NOT GO TO ADVANCED AUTO!!! Be warned! Go to the Sun Devil Auto on 50th St and Ray Rd. They are awesome! They towed my car for free too! I was have given them no stars but thats not an option.
4,"I was trying to find a good deal on getting my brakes done.  It had been six months since my brake light had gone on...you know the one...not the one where you put your foot on the brakes and the lights outside go on, but the one that tells you your brakes are bad.  Six months.  I was in denial. \n\n Anyway, I took it to one place where I had to wait at least ten minutes just to get to the counter to ask for a ball park figure.  They said anywhere from 400 to 1500 and I would need to give them plenty of time.  While standing in line there, I spoke with another customer who told me to go to Advanced Auto on Warner. This person said she had been there before and they were reasonable and the service was of high quality. \n\n I went right over and the very, very nice guy (Jeff, I think) said he'd put it up on the rack right then and there, and tell me what, exactly it would cost.  Once on the rack, he took me in, showed me what it should look like compared with another car on a rack that had decent brakes.  He explained everything, but all I could think of was, \""Okay, how much?\""  It turned out to be close to 800.  (cringe, cringe, cringe)  But it needed pretty much everything by now. Not everything, but a lot.  He told me he could do it right then, and it would take 2 hours.  He also did all that he could to bring the price down, looking for coupons etc.  \n\nIn less than 2 hours it was complete and I have peace of mind.  The people at the shop were incredibly friendly, the place itself was great. Clean waiting area, etc etc.  I would highly recommend Advanced Auto and I do believe you get what you pay for.  Although it seemed pricey, I still think it was a great place.  If anything changes, I'll edit this review. In the meantime, yep, I recommend it."
2,"If you have easy task, like oil change, brake service, and any other minor services, this is the place to go to.  They also have coupons on line to save you few bucks.  If you need to do major services, you should probably find more professional places or go back to your dealers."
0,Paid for some repair work here. After the problem continued I took it to another mechanic. I was informed that the spark plugs and air filter for the ac I paid to be replaced were never done. When I spoke with them regarding this issue they were very rude and aggressive.
4,"If you want quality service, see the team at Advanced for ALL your car care needs. I'm proud to say that ive been a client to Jeff and his team for many years. The moment you walk n they are ready to assist your needs but also deliver a great product. Put your confidence and service needs in the hands of the Advanced team. Remember we the consumer always take time to complain but we also need to take time to let them know when you receive quality service. I just had some AC work completed along with an alignment to keep my car up and running. Two thumbs up!!"
3,"When I am hungry for Chinese take-out, I go to Abacus Inn. Located just west of I-10 on Elliot in the Safeway/Walgreens shopping center, Abacus Inn is convenient to most Ahwatukee residents. I've enjoyed the beef with broccoli, sizzling rice soup, however my favorite is the moo shu pork with plum sauce.  Service is super quick. They are always polite. I often have a half-off coupon for second entree since those coupons are in the mail frequently. Its economical even without."
0,"Place smells very very musky-mildewy. I should have left when I smelled the place. I ordered their \""house chicken\"" - it was basically overcooked fried chicken in a very watered down teriyaki sauce - I ate two bites and asked for the check. Husband ordered beef with broccoli - it was cold. Don't waste your time. Go to Great Wok instead for great take out."
1,"Bland, boring, uninteresting typical American Chinese food. Nothing to write home about."
3,"Killer lunch specials that are hard to beat... always coupons in local papers and clipits for dinners as well.\n\nI've been to Abacus about 8 times now and have failed to leave a review for them so here's the breakdown.\n\nFood is good... probably not the best I've ever had but definitely nothing wrong with any of the meals I've had there, and I've never eaten the same thing twice as I've been trying to eat different things each time.  Their menu is pretty big and can get a little confusing for somebody with ADD like me but hey you get a lot of good stuff to choose from.\n\nService is always very prompt and they're very nice as well.\n\nCost is average, but like I said, get the coupons from local papers... \n\nAll in all, I like Abacus and I'll continue to frequent there when I'm in my chinese food moods :)"
1,"Seriously unimpressed. Ordered delivery from here last night. Lots of food, but not much flavor. I had orange chicken.. One slice of orange in the whole order and not much orange flavor (or any other either). Hubby had Szechuan Chicken. It had a very strong onion flavor - but not much other flavor. We also ordered Pot Stickers. They were big, but again - not very flavorful.\n\nAll in all, not worth the wait or the money. I guess it would do in a pinch, but not if I had any other options."
2,"Great service, order at the counter, nice specials, good standards, ok salsa and fun ambiance. I have just never had anything that wowed me or tasted \""just right\"" so I gave it three stars."
0,This location has closed.
0,"Sorry folks, Chuy's is no longer open at this location. It is now a restaurant called \""Bisquits\""' serving breakfast and lunch."
4,"My wife and I went for our first visit and were thrilled by the knowledge, passion, and true healing that Dr. Nemanic provided. He instantly diagnosed solutions for problems that have long nagged at us. Wholeheartedly recommend him."
4,"Dr. Nemanic has treated me on 2 separate occasions in the last 18 months for pain experienced in my hip due to an inherent weakness.  I'm an active individual (running, biking, sports) and cannot believe how helpful he's been in getting me back on track almost immediately.  His no-nonsense communication approach makes understanding the issue very easy.  I appreciate his desire to not see me again unless there's a problem -- it's incredibly refreshing.  Needless to say, I do highly recommend him because of his effectiveness, ease in understanding, and professionalism."
4,"I am always skeptical of YELP scores that are perfect 5's.  Really?  No one has EVER complained about this vendor?  So, I waited and waited, for months, to come up with some reason to give Dr. Nemanic something less than a 5 star rating.  I can't do it.  He's truly exceptional and terribly pain relieving!\n\n(Although I guess he could get a lower rating for being too far from my house, but really, that's not fair and he's overcome that objection by being so awesome.)\n\nA few months ago I was in a lot of pain. I called 2 other Chiropractors near to my home and explained the pain and my severe, nearly immobilizing, discomfort.  Much to my chagrin, they mentioned that they could schedule time for me 2-3 days, even a few weeks, out in their schedule. I couldn't believe it. I was nearly crying on the phone.\n\nThat led me to YELP and to Dr. Nemanic.  What happened on the phone with him was as remarkable as what happened in the office.  \""Can I see you in 45 minutes?\""  he said!  Yes, in less than an hour I was experiencing less pain that I had experienced in months...and just weeks before my summer tour of Utah and Iowa and Wisconsin, I was able to sleep through the night without waking up in tears.  \n\nDr. Nemanic not only adjusted my back and neck to ensure a predictable and continued recovery, but he offered additional advice on other areas of intrigue (my legs not pointing forward, my lower back pain, my workout efforts, etc.) and encouraged me to move forward slowly but surely into a healthier status that I was before the fateful \""fall\"" that brought me to his doorstep in the first place.  \n\nI highly recommend this Dr. no matter where you live in the valley...drive there, enjoy the experience, and don't forget to thank me and the other YELPers who have led you to this place of blissful painlessness."
0,"When I started seeing Dr. Nemanic I had high hopes. \n\nHe was sure he could fix me, he said he accepted my insurance, he seemed nice, and I trusted him. \n\nTrust is a pretty important thing when it comes to patient and medical provider relations. \nUnfortunately I wasn't able to keep this trust in him. \n\nI saw him multiple times a week for a series of weeks, and saw no improment what so ever. \nThat does not go to say that he is necessarily to blame for this. I've never received any benefit from any Chriopractor I've ever seen. I hoped he however would be able to help me on account of his marvelous Yelp reviews, and his sureness he could help.\n\nI stopped seeing him a few months back after I didn't quite notice any improvement from one treatment to the next/any improment over the course of seeing him. \nEven though I didn't see any improvement, I kept coming back with hope that I would soon \""stick\"" with my adjustments. \nThe reason I stopped seeing him wasn't even because I didn't see improement but instead because he insulted me to my face. \n\nDuring one session I asked him why I wasn't able to have a specific point on my back pop ever, by anyone. \nHe then told me I tend to lock up when I'm being adjusted, and proceeded to ask me if I was a control freak. As I said \""uhh\"", before giving me a chance to even answer, he smiled and said \""you're a control freak\"". \n\nThis really left an awful taste in my mouth. Rather than suggesting ways I could relax, or telling me to try something, he flat out called me a control freak, and pinned it as the reason I wasn't able to be fully adjusted. \nI have severe anxiety problems, and well, I was in pain... Naturally wouldn't one subconsciously lock up when a man twice your size is moving bits of your body around and it hurts? I wasn't knowingly doing this, it was entirely involutary. \n\nWhether or not I am a control freak is not what is in question here, it's the fact that rather than giving medical advice or offering help, he insulted me. Neither me or insurance, were paying him for his opinion on my personality type. We were paying him for his medical services, which after months I recieved zero benefit from. \n\nBut wait, there's more. \nI guess my insurance was barely paying him at all, and why's that?\nWhen I asked him whether or not my insurance plan was in network with him, he told me it was. And I trusted him. Why? Because why would anyone question it any further?\n\nToday I got a call from his office today notifying me that I had an outstanding balance. After asking why I was told because he wasn't actually in network for ME and that every plan was different.  \nHmm, well wouldn't that have been nice to know at the start of seeing him? Because honestly, had I known, I would have NEVER seen him in the first place. \nI am a student. I do not have the kind of money to spend on multiple Chiropractic appointments a week, that is unless my insurance company is covering me. \nThis bugs me, but what really bugs me is that fact that this could have been caught after the first appointmentm, if he was billing my appointments as they happened. He could have told me, after one visit, that he wasn't covered under my insurance's co-pay. \n\nInstead, over the course of seeing him, he insulted me, left me feeling no better, and also left me with a couple hundred dollar tab that wouldn't exist if he just checked if he was in network for me BEFORE my first visit. \n\nHe puts a whole new meaning to \""adding insult to injury\""."
4,"I started seeing Dr. Nemanic to treat migraines, and he ended up fixing a 20 year old injury that I had given up on years ago.  I have been through many chiropractors over the years, and Dr. Nemanic is far and away the best and most effective doctor I have seen.  His knowledge and patience have been transformational for me, and I continue to feel better than I have in years after every visit.  Beyond the immediate fix, he has also taught me how to care for my injury so that I can continue to live pain free in the future. I am so grateful I found him, and highly recommend him!"
4,"Truly happy with the decision to visit this office. My back was killing me and I couldn't stand up straight from moving homes over the last few weeks. The doctor took the time to explain to me what was going on with my back pain, how to prevent in the future, and some stretches to do at home to help with the healing process. I was in and out quickly and it's only been a day and I can feel the healing has begun. I have found my new chiropractor!! Other chiropractors I have seen are pushing things that will just run up my insurance bill. I feel this doctor is all about solution and healing. I will be back, and since I work down the road I have already started referring my coworkers. Thanks so much!! 6 stars!!\nMuch!!"
4,I've been to plenty of chiropractors to know Dr Nemanic IS THE VERY BEST OUT THERE. His wealth of knowledge and his ability to find and problem and fix it is astounding! Truly he is the real deal. I am a 53 young women super healthy fit who has spent a lot if time and money in the pursuit of health. He is THE BEST. I'm heading back to Utah for the summer and if I have a situation that I need a chiropractor I will be flying back to see him.
4,"Dr. Peter is the best chiropractor I've ever seen.  He listens, is thorough, and what he does is so much more than adjustment.  \nEvery visit he gets to the deeper issues, helps you talk out what's going on in your life that could be negatively affecting you physically.  \nSo many of us walk around with pain inside that we don't address.  He then aligns everything so you literally walk out feeling like you can conquer the world! \nHe has helped me with issues I've had for years; that others have not addressed or thought they could do anything to help. \nEvery visit is an adjustment from head to toe. Dr Peter never leaves anything out and addresses all of your issues and concerns. I'm so thankful I met him.  \nOne of my shoulders has been higher than the other for a few years now...we talked about it during my last visit.  He did some muscle work and by the time I left it was dramatically improved.  I could literally see the difference immediately. \nI couldn't say enough good things about him. \nHis hours are super flexible with evenings and Saturday hours available.  Dr. Peter is conveniently located at the I10 and Warner in Ahwatukee so it's great I can run over there during my lunch.   Although if you don't live close...he is worth the drive!!! \nWhatever you've got going on...call Dr. Peter.  I've referred a ton of friends to him and every single person has been ecstatic about the care they received and the relief... even on the first visit.  \nThank you Dr Peter!"
2,"My friend had told me about Toy Town. I'd read the Yelp reviews and some were good, others not so complimentary. So what was my erperience? The girl on the till as you enter had the carisma of a gnat (no hello, no talking, I had to ask all the questions) and the place itself was quite small. It was also very dark which I did not understand until I had a good look and realised that the place needed a good lick of paint and some cleaning. The bathroom in particular would benefit from a good scrub! There was also no where for adults to sit/mingle so we ended up sitting on chairs meant for 2 year olds! It's a pity because there's a lot of wasted space at the front of the unit which could benefit from some chairs/sofas being put there and which would still allow you a view of your child playing. I felt I was in the way of the kids the whole time as I had no where to go and had to stand. When it got busy and there were more kids in, it was a bit chaotic given how small the place is. So those are the negatives, now the positives; the concept itself and the the actual houses are lovely. Each one has a theme i.e. a firehouse, a library, a bank etc. There are plenty of toys and the older girls especially seemed to love dressing up in the costumes. I think if you were to take the idea of the place and the houses and put them in a bigger, cleaner and better laid out premisis you'd have a real winner on your hands. Will I go back, yes because my son had a good time there. We stayed for 2 hours and it was $10. I believe you can stay for as long as you want. I just get the feeling though that whoever own's it has let it go and if they just put a bit of effort into it, it could be a brilliant place to bring your kids...."
1,"I really like the idea of this place.  My 1.5 year old daughter had a lot of fun here.  But...\n - We went with a moms group and there were probably about 10 of us (plus kids), and there were probably another 5 other moms and kids.  So in total there were somewhere around 30 people there, and it felt rather crowded.  I don't know if this size crowd is normal for the place but if it is, as another reviewer mentioned, more shopping carts and cars are needed.\n - I have no idea how often the place is cleaned, so I'm not saying it wasn't clean, I'm just saying it didn't feel clean to me.  And the automatic air freshener (that you often times find in bathrooms) didn't make the place feel any fresher.\n - The biggest minus is the cost of admission.  It's $10 for the kids to get in (free for adults), but I'd rather spend a smidge more and go to the AMY or CMoP."
1,"This place is a great idea for kids under 5, and my daughter loved it. The biggest issue I had was that it smelled like dirty diapers in the whole place due to an old diaper genie in the bathroom that needs replacing. Additionally, we went 1h after opening and the place was filthy. The carpets need a good steam clean, the furniture all needs a wipe down, etc. Toy Town is a great neighborhood play center that could use a serious, and regular cleaning."
1,Mct oil buy 2 get the second half off. Good deal. The employees were pestering me to buy stuff even after I told them I knew what I was looking for.
2,"I buy ProMax bars here pretty regular. Their prices are about average on protein/workout supplement products, but they seem to be the only place that carries the lemon flavored promax for some reason. Store reps are always giving samples to me of stuff I'm frankly not going to use, but I guess they gotta try to sell stuff, so no harm no foul there.\nAs long as you don't mind the occasionally over-zealous sales person it's an alright place."
2,"Native New Yorker is your average pizza and wings joint. The good thing is that they don't just serve pizza and wings. There are plenty of sandwiches, burgers, sliders, and salads to choose from too. There are TV's everywhere showing all types of sports going on. Tuesdays are cheap wing days (25 cents, I think. I could be wrong) and Thursdays are boneless wing days..mmm boneless wings. I only go there when I'm craving some grease, so that tells you the quality of the food. It's not bad at all, it's just not good for you! Even most of their salads come with something fried on top of them. I would imagine the place loads up after work. I've never been. Today I had their buffalo chicken pizza. Eh... it wasn't spicy at all. I was kind of bummed. The waitress gladly brought me a side of wing sauce to give it a kick. My lunch pal had some wings and potato skins...healthy. He said that everything was delicious. We made a deal to come back and try the boneless wings on Thursday...stand by for an update. Bottom line, Native New Yorker is an a-ok place to eat! Nothing terribly fancy, but your run of the mill sports bar. Not a bad place for a wing fix at lunch time!"
0,"While I have not eaten at this particular NNY( I moved here from NY and is not that \""native\""...at all) it's 2 min away from where I live.Food is meh at the other ones though.  I just saw Devon review and I'm appalled and disgusted. If in fact it's  true, I will never visit this restaurant and will urge everyone I know to do the same as well. It is one thing to have different believes and a whole other to display such hatred and bigotry. \nI appreciate this type of reviews, that way I can avoid places like this."
1,"Wings were not what we ordered (maybe she should have written it down) had to ask for napkins (really, with wings) no soda refills (not one) she would actually stop by and ask if we needed anything else. Really? Take a look around! Then she has to audacity to ask if we were going to be ordering anything else, because she was getting ready to get off. AYFKM? This service just sucked, and the wings were totally saturated with sauce when I explicitly mentioned how I wanted mine. Anyway, I will not be going back to the Native here again for some time. I have found my place for Wings and it is Teakwoods!"
2,"One thing Native does well is wings.  I usually get their Asiago Dusted Parmesan wings.  Love them.  They are a bit oily and greasy, but hey.. they're wings!\n\nThis last trip I went my buddy and I ordered those wings, but on the menu they show up as Asiago wings going on medium wings.  I asked them to put them on the hot instead.  But instead, they gave us regular hot wings with Parmesan on it..  So... the wings weren't great.\n\nWas bummed, but I'll go again down the road."
1,"\""You guys have any specials running tonight?\""\n  \""Yeah 22oz domestic drafts for $3.\""\n\""Okay cool, I'll take a Blue Moon.\""\n  \""That's not part of the special.\""\n\""Is it on draft?\""\n  \""Yes.\""\n\""It's made by Coors.\""\n  \""Yeah, well.\"" \n\nSo... it's not ALL domestic drafts. It's just the cheapa-- domestic drafts.\n\nI can't stand stuff like this. The guy was friendly enough though."
1,"Eesh. I'm going to try to avoid this place. I'll admit it's not my style at all though it suits others just fine: not veg friendly, not energetic, not worth the money. I don't have to eat like a health nut to enjoy my food, but even their french fries suck. And that's my main criteria for judging mediocre venues with limited meatless fare. You could earn an entire star with good french fries despite a crappy atmostphere. Native New Yorker? Fail.\n\nThe other food I saw wandering around looked pretty, um, bad...from what I hear the pizza is especially unappetizing. The waitstaff was average and on the slow side. The beer selection is ok and I sat contently with my Stella. But overall this is not my scene."
3,"This little hidden gem deserves more credit than it gets.  I had a fabulous cobb salad that I would rate better than most Sports Bars would have.\n\nThere was a separated bar and restaurant which is always a bonus for this kind of restaurant, it was clean, lit up and plenty-o-TV's.  The service was very good and I would go back in a heart beat to try their wings and pizza."
0,"I can honestly say that this was one of the worst meals I have eaten in a long time.\n\nMy boyfriend suggested a particular local sit-down pizza joint, so I drove to where I thought I'd seen it located, but it turned out to be Native New Yorker instead. We were hungry so we decided to give it a whirl anyway.\n\nMy boyfriend is not hard to please when it comes to pizza, he's a standard pepperoni kinda guy. He ordered a 10\"" pepperoni pizza, which looked like your average pizza, no frills. After the first bite, he gave a thumbs down and made a sad face. All this, coming from a man who regularly eats junky chain pizzas without complaint. He said the crust was bland, the sauce didn't taste like much and it was waaaay greasy. I tried some myself and it was truly awful pizza.\n\nI ordered the Linebacker sandwich (turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mozzarella, avocado) which sounded promising and looked quite good as well. The turkey was standard shaved deli counter meat with little flavor, the lettuce and tomato was fine, the bacon added some much needed salt to the sandwiched , and the avocado was very unripe, thus flavorless. The only saving grace of the sandwich that made it palatable was the bread roll which had a decent crust on it. For my side, I opted for their \""house-made chips\"". They looked awesome, a good golden brown and sliced very thin lengthwise. Sadly, they were served completely cold and undersalted. Some were pretty floppy and undercooked. I know they're potato chips, but was I wrong in assuming that they might have been fried to order and served hot?\n\nThe more I think about this meal, the more upset I get. While the price for our meal wasn't outrageous, the food was still amazingly mediocre. I don't like knowing I could have gone to the Safeway and bought a pre-made deli turkey sandwich for $3.99 that would have been basically just as tasty as something I paid more than double for. I've noticed that many reviews mention the chicken wings as being especially good, but I don't know if I'll give them another chance so I could find out."
2,"Pretty good wings, but the beer selection is trapped in the 90's (or maybe the 80's).  In an era where you can get a serviceable IPA in any generic chain restaurant in town, this place is relentlessly hop-free.  For the love of god, it's time for a change. The Four Peaks truck is already dropping off Kilt Lifter...how about adding Hop Knot. Or Odell IPA, Stone IPA, or even just Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.\n\nUpdating to three stars because now they have Hop Knot on tap!"
1,I like their food menu but the service wasn't great and their happy hour was seriously lacking selection! Nothing was very clear and our waitress seemed as though it was the worst day of her life and waiting on us was the cherry on top. My girlfriends and I won't be going back for happy hour.
1,"Visited this location for the first time tonight.  I had the California Chicken sandwich and substituted the broccoli for the fries\n\nThe chicken sandwich was excellent,  very tasty.   However the broccoli was very bland like it was washed under hot water and served.   It definitely could have used a step up or two in flavor.   \n\nFor dessert I got a piece of  cheesecake to go with strawberries.   It was a good portion,  but just average in flavor.   However, they did't pack any plastic wear or napkins with it which I would assume there would be with a to go order."
2,"The Good: We absolutely love their wings and its becoming a regular for us to go every other Tuesday for their wing deal. We always get the honey hot wings and share a side of either regular fries or the loaded fries.\n\nThe Bad: I do feel the wings are a bit too pricey, even on the deal days. Also, what is up with their high school hostesses!? They are incredibly rude and give dirty looks every single time we have gone, which is now around 7 times. Someone really needs to put these girls in check. Goodness. This is the reason for 3 stars instead of 4. I would actually give it 3.5 stars if I could.\n\nWe like the atmosphere and it always seems clean and the servers have been very nice so far."
2,typical bar food nothing special imo
0,"I will never eat at this location again! I went in on a Friday afternoon with my two nephews, ages 10 and 7. My 7 yr. old nephew carried in his bag of lunch from McDonald's. We were seated in a booth; the waitress took our drink orders. Not a minute later the Manager (Brian) came over to our booth, seated himself next to my 10 yr. old nephew and inquired how our day was going. \n\nThe manager then proceeded to advise me, he normally would not allow outside food to be eaten in his restaurant. I understood and completely accepted his request. However he went on to state \""I will not kick you out this time! But next time you will know not to bring in outside food, which can cause food poisoning, and can be blamed on this restaurant\""! \n\n I was shocked, this man would use the term \""Kick you out\"" and refer to my nephew's food as possibly being poisonous. \n\nHe should have called me to the side and simply explained outside food if not allowed, and left it at that! My seven year old nephew (in fear of his potentially poisonous burger) asked \""Why is that man going to \""Kick\"" us out?\nI simply greeted Manager Brian with a smile, and made a mental note never to return, and right this review! \n\nPoor customer service, rude manager, verbally threatening to children and customers; I have a very young look about me, however I'm 36 yrs. old and deserve to be treated respectfully!"
1,"The wings were just fine, but the restaurant seemed dirty.  The floor was sticky, the tables had not been cleaned, and the whole place smelled like stale beer.  I wasn't looking for fine dining, but I was looking for a place that looks like it passed it's health inspection.  I don't think I will be returning on my next trip."
3,2nd favoring wing joint in Phoenix.  (Vine 1st). Hot wings and there honey hot is good.  Wait staff is good.  Throughout the years the native has been inconsistent- recommend going during a game to get the best wing experience.
1,Seems to be going downhill. Orders get messed up regularly and food quality is decreasing. It almost feels like they're trying to cut corners. \n\nMy last visit included terrible service with half of our orders (party of 8) incorrect. Lunch service seems worse than dinner. I've been going here for years and it feels like owners have forgotten about this one.
1,"She was about to give the next table to another guy,  when L stepped in and said something.  She had the nerve to tell that guy, oh sorry ihave to say summertime else first, I'll tell you why later.  Really? Are you twelve? And right in front of us? Really great customer service. She needs to go because she can't handle the pressure. Why they don't invest in those buzzers for these events.  Not very happy. .. we come here quite a bit and his family is here every Monday. I'll flag manager down, if I can. I had to downgrade my rating this time. Food rocks, but they need to reassess their Hostess."
2,"Went there last night with some friends. We decided to sit in the patio since we get pretty loud and it seemed like everyone was watching the SUNS game in the lobby, so we were like, lets chill outside. So we walk up to the tables, one after another and they were all DIRTY and stank of beer. Checked atleast 8 tables and decided to eat in the lobby. Does anyone ever cleans the patio area? 3 stars is for the awesome and quick service. Wings came out right away and were deliciously seasoned. Wings were perfect. Please tell your waitresses to clean the patio once a month atleast."
3,"Great place for sports and wings.  Love the mild wings and season tots. Service was good. Open pretty late which is nice.  Tuesday's special 35\u00a2 wings.  Deal is like a sore dick, you can't beat it!"
2,"Nothin great, ur typical bar n grill... Not much of a fan of native just came to meet a few friends here to watch the finals. I will say staff is friendly and they keep the place clean."
0,"This chain used to have good food. Now everything but the chicken sucks and sucks badly. I go here to sing karaoke, I'll eat someplace else."
0,"My family and I have been fans of this Native location for years now, but after our past couple of visits, I'm not sure if we'll be back again.\n\nLast week, the female hostess treated us \""fair,\"" but nothing too bad to complain about. During our dinner, we accidentally spilled a drink on our table, and as we tried to clean up our mess, a female worker saw what happened and walked right on by, acting as if she did not see anything. That is not customer service. We eventually flagged down a different worker, who we asked for a towel to clean the mess, she brought us a towel and we cleaned our table. Just as we finished, the party behind us spilled a drink also, so we handed them our towel as a kind gesture. Just then the same girl walked by, saw what happened to them also, and did not have the courtesy to ask what she could do. Okay, we will give Native another chance next time...\n\nToday, my mother and I went to Native for dinner. As we walked in, the hostess was blatantly unfriendly and unorganized. We told her we wanted a booth, and she said okay. We then sat down and waited for a couple of minutes until my mother noticed that newcomers were being sat down, despite the fact that we were there first. My mom then walked over and asked the female hostess if she took our party name to be seated. She replied, \""yes.\"" My mother then asked what the party name was. She replied, \""Dan.\"" My mother said no that is not our name, and the female then asked what our party name was. Who knows where the name \""Dan\"" came from. The bottom line is that they were unprofessional, and not only that, but she was very snotty and rude.\n\nMy mother worked in customer service for 18 years, and knows that any worker should take their job as serious as possible. It's a shame that businesses hire poor employees, whom ruin the experience of the business itself for customers. \n\nHope this helps, and wish you all luck on your next visit to Native. God Bless!"
2,"To clarify my last view, whst sucks here is the FOOD. The service here; whether at the bar or on the dining floor has ALWAYS been exemplary. A great many of the staff have been here a great many years, that speaks well of management as well. What used to be a great regional chain has lost it's uniqueness due to corporate interference. Go back to the original menu abd quit trying to be Applebee's."
1,"Service was great. I tried boneless mandarin orange. I was told it tasted like orange chicken, only It didn't taste anywhere near orange chicken. I was disappointed.\n\nI will try this place again, I always give places another try."
0,"I will never come to this native ever again.\nFirst we sit down and order the drinks but our waitress forgets till after we are almost done with our appetizers. \nThats was okay....maybe she was having a bad night...\n\nThen she brings us the wrong order and says thats what we ordered...honestly I order the same thing every single time... \nShe keeps making it sound like its our fault...\nOkay...\n\nThen when we are done eating, we stacked our plates to show her that we were ready to pay...\nBut she sat in the corner with other servers getting a shoulder massage...wth. \n\nSo my husband walks up to her to ask for the check on his way to use the restroom.\n\nAs i waited...my husband comes back and still no check. \n\nIn the meantime the server goes to the table behind us and chats with the customer about their favorite drinks...THEN tosses the check over my husbands shoulder onto the table without any words!!! WTF!"
1,"My father drags me everywhere--from Fry's Electronics to Popeye Chicken (UGH). Native Grill & Wings is actually one of the few places in which I do not dislike anything. I decided to write a simple easy review on this particular location, so why not? Let's cut to the chase.\n\nPros:\nI'm not exactly a sports fan, but this is DEFINITELY a place for one. There are TVs everywhere, throughout the patios, the indoor areas, and at the bar. They are all constantly switched on to ESPN, FOX Sports, and on rare occasions, ESPN2. From the looks of it, it seemed impossible to not have a clear view of the TV screen without having someone's head, arm, etc. block your way. We came on Sunday, and the wings are crazy cheap. The fish and chips had a pretty decent taste, as we split them all up between the three of us. The service was not particularly the nicest, nor the meanest, but was speedy when talking to us. They had great placing of all the heat lamps and chairs outside in the patio, so it is great to come during the winter. The location is fairly large, so you can almost always find a table to sit at.\n\nCons:\nThe patio had not many places to put your used cigarettes. I am not a smoker, nor do I give any offense to smokers, but the patio REEKS of smoke. The service here is fast-speaking, but not exactly fast-moving. We waited for several minutes between when we asked for the check and the delivery of the check itself. The fish and chips had decent taste, but not decent size. They were tiny compared to the fish and chips in the OTHER location for the same price and meal. I was really disappointed when I saw this. We did not get enough wings. There were only 4 wings for the 3 of us for EACH dish. \n\nOverall, this is simply not the greatest restaurant I've experienced. Its other competitors were able to show a performance at least twenty times better than this one. Thanks, but I'd rather visit the Ahwatukee location from this time on."
0,"Worse place I have ever lived. The apartments are nice but if anything breaks it can take maintenance up to 10 months to fix it (even if it is something easy). The office staff has no idea what they are doing, they lose rent payments then charge a late fee even if you provide them with the receipt they gave you for your payment. They are friendly, nice and will do anything to get you to move in but once you sign the lease your stuck and they ignore you to try and help more people sign leases."
0,"I am a current resident here and would do anything to move right now. Shortly after we moved in our showers stopped working half of the time (no water coming out of shower head, loud noise you could hear outside...), along with a laundry list of items throughout the apartment that were damaged or not functioning properly (i.e. ceiling fan in living room that was broken). I have put in three maintenance requests, talked to the manager and even contacted corporate regarding this. I received the run around \""It has been fixed,\"" \""It will be fixed in this week,\"" \""We did not see anything that needed to be fixed.\"" Only when I contacted corporate did they actually act like they cared and came in to fix these issues after months and sent a plumbing crew to fix the showers. Since then, our showers are still having problems. Along with the maintenance issues, they will do anything to get your money and make your lease worth breaking. Unfortunately, I had to resign the lease and I am now being charges hundreds of dollars. I went in prior to my lease expiring to take care of the paperwork, which was not ready. They called me one day after saying everything was ready but since I did not sign by the due date I will incur late fees and an extra charge on my monthly rental charge. They do not mandate pool policy and the cops have been called multiple times for noise violations at night, teenagers fighting, people smoking/drinking during the day, small children unattended (as little as three years old)..you name it. This place is awful and if I would've known the problems beforehand, I would've gladly paid a bit more and moved into a complex that actually cared about their residents... or even acted like it. Not to mentions, there is NO parking at night!"
1,"Been here 1month. Tried for 1 mth to see our floor plan but they never got it cleaned. Said too many others rented & they came first. Misunderstanding of the non-refundable dog deposit, which happens but Elana ARGUED with us over how she was right, we were wrong. Really nice landscaping but apts really need work inside. FP tile cracked, nail polish on bathroom counter but worst is rusty, soap scummy shower door. Should have been replaced. You can really hear upstairs neighbors walking. And now cockroaches! I called for service and was told lock my dogs in a room for 8 hrs as they had no idea when it would occur. Elana said could do nothing about that. I emailed home office which did give me a 4 hr window. I know cockroaches happen BUT GROSS.  If Pinnacle was priced about $100-150 less a month I'd say it was worth it. But for $1000 a month it's not. I can put up with a lot, like bad customer service, but not cockroaches. I'll update next month to see where we are with the critters"
1,"Still have giant sewer roaches. Upstairs neighbors, been here 5 years, say it started about 8 mths ago. Although Elna in office implied they came with us! One so big he should share the rent!AC unit dripped from ceiling during humid months. Maintance out 3x for it, told me old stuff just put a pan down. Termite tunnel on living room wall, exterminators had to be called. This place is just old and crumbling down and buggy! This was supposed to be 8 mths while we looked for a new house. Hoping that happens sooner and will happily pay to get out of my lease. $1200 to leave here is worth it!"
0,And now the scorpions have arrived. Worst place I've ever lived! More bugs then I've ever seen
0,"Manager Nick called us when exterminators arrived so husband could meet them. So nice of him. But I think Pinnacle just doesn't understand customer service. We got notice yesterday that Wed, Thurs & Fri all apartments would be inspected. Could be in and out several times a day. Called office about our dogs. Once again told close them up in a room for 8 hours. I asked office to call me back. But if Pinnacle had  good customer service skills they would have a solution to this type of problem to begin with. And they only work with me when I take my problem to social media. Sad\n\n* came home to letter that Pinnacles property management, Essex, computers have been hacked. They have no info yet on what was compromised. But do offer a 12 mth credit alert service free of charge. People I don't know if this is just my bad luck but you can't make this stuff up. Pinnacle PLEASE let me break my lease. We just aren't good for eachother lol"
4,"The UPS store was a very good experience. The lady behind the counter was really helpful in allowing me to select packing material, repackage my parcel, and pay the postage. I had to repackage the parcel in the store, and she was very patient and helpful, even helping get more packing peanuts for me to use. \n\nI will definitely go back again (hopefully better prepared next time)!"
4,"My husband and I went to mail a couple of packages at the Post Office off of Priest Dr. Between Warner Rd. and Elliot. The girl at the pick up door was very rude  so we basically said, \""Okay, thank you\"" and left. \n\nWe drove to the UPS store on Ray and 48th St. They were awesome! They filled the box with popcorn and taped it shut for us, at no extra charge (The girl at the Post Office was going to charge us $4 for tape). At the UPS store, it even cost less to ship our packages. They were extremely helpful, friendly.  We will definitely drive the extra 5 minutes to have such good customer service."
4,"Probably the nicest McDonalds I've been in in a while. Staff is friendly, place is spotless, and on table has video games built into the counter for the kids. Pretty cool."
1,"To say the employees here are rude would be putting it mildly. \n\nI come here frequently, not because it is the best McDonald's, but rather because it is the closest McDonald's. The food here is okay at best, for a McDonald's. It's certainly better than either location on Chandler Boulevard. However, my major complaint is that no matter what time of day I come or if I go drive through versus inside, not a single employee thanks me for my business. \n\nIt especially irks me because as someone who has worked customer service, I always make a point of thanking the people who are providing me the service. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the same courtesy from people where I choose to spend my money, thus providing them a job.\n\nApart from the blatantly rude service, this location seems to have a problem with employees never emptying trash cans. Especially at the drive through. I can't count how many times I've come, even in the morning, and that trashcan is overflowing. I'm not sure if it's a problem for the health department or not, but I can tell you that it's really disgusting to see birds and flies hang around the trashcan right in front of where I'm picking up my food. Food and trash literally overflow. It's a similar case inside the restaurant, especially at the cans near the bathroom.\n\nOverall this is an okay McDonald's if you just need one that's close by, but don't expect it to be a great McDonald's."
1,1. went for oil change\n2. said it'll be 10mins. manager greets me and is very nice\n3. waiting area is clean\n4. young man from nebraska tries to upsell me over 600$ in stuff... i think overkill!  he was not in a pleasent mood once my guy friend walked over- he didnt make eye contact or even smile\n5. 15 mins.still waiting..... young man came in said it's going to take longer because whoever changes  my oil is doing it wrong.\n6.37dollars for an oil change when i coulda driven a lil further and been happier!   I will never go back customer service is huge!
0,"I come here religiously to get the oil changed in my bosses Cadillac.  At this point, I know more about that car than anyone else in the world.  I know how many miles it's at and how many more miles to go until it needs the oil changed, the tires rotated, the fuel system cleaned and when it needs a new air filter - it's sure as hell not every single time I bring it in!   It never fails though that they pull out that perfectly white air filter and tell me I need a new one.   I use to quip back \""it's recommend that the filter be changed every 15,000 miles, it's only been 4,500.\""  I'm past that point, now I just give them the \""I take no bullshit\"" look and they say \""you know on second thought, it doesn't need to be replaced.\""  I'm sick of these guys but my boss insists I go here and he always gets what he wants."
0,I just recently moved here from Texas and this is the first place I went to for an oil change. The first time service was fine. I expect people to attempt the up-sale on items and they do. That's their job. However I expected the work to be done right. For 3000 miles after the first change I've had an oil leak. The second 3000 miles the oil leak worsened and caused problems with my engine. I went to them between that time and I was told oils full and no leaks were evident but the oil light kept coming on. I checked myself and the leaks were both in evident spots with the oil filter being one. $300 later and a second opinion I'm good to go. I never comment on things like this but that shows me that they don't care about taking care of your cars but more about the money spent upon visit.
3,This place was right off the freeway on my way to Tucson.  I loved that it wasn't busy at all and I was able to get in and out.  The guys working here were friendly and didn't try to up-sell me at all.
0,"Awful service, and terrible treatment.  I have gone here Jiffy lubes all over the country, and I have to say these guys are the exception,  They are constantly trying to push unneeded or unnecessary service (like replacing a battery with half a charge stating that it could go at anytime).  Whenever I have received service from this, my vehicle always runs low on oil after about 3500 miles.  When I receive service at other locations, I have not had any of these problems,.  That is why I will not return to this specific Jiffy Lube."
0,"This franchise group can care less about their customers.  I had a problem they contacted me quickly, went to look at my vehicle then never responded to my questions again.  I have never been treated so poorly by any establishment and this franshise group had the worst customer service ever.  I read their BBB complaints and they denied every single one, just like mine.  I recommend going to brakes lus or any other company, they are very nice, kind and half the cost of Jiffy Lube."
4,"Aight pimps and players here's the lowdown. If you have some kicks that need some lovin' I suggest you take a dip in your Cadillac over to Express Shoe Repair.\n\nI'm not one of these cats that has 50 pairs of shoes; I'd rather have 5 or 6 (1-2 formal, 1-2 casual, etc.) that are right on point in regards to my style and the occasion. While I must admit that I am always cool like the breeze ever so often one of my women may get a little overzealous upon the sight of me and scuff my gators in the midst of their excitement. I can't have this...scuffed gators make you look like the biggest square since Madison.\n\nIn the event this occurs, I dip on over to Express Shoe Repair. Mario \""The Man with The Plan\"" has worked his magic on a couple of pairs of my kicks. Never once, have I not cheesed like Chuck E. upon picking up my kicks. Once, I even noticed a small imperfection (Hey, a player of my stature has to pay attention to detail, you know?) and my man, Mario took the kicks back, reworked the entire job and I picked them up the next day free of charge for the additional work. You heard me right; there were no dead presidents diggin' the scene.\n\nMain idea: This is the place to be if you get down in the Ahwatukee, Tempe, Chandler, or Mesa neck of the woods and you need a doctor for your kicks, luggage or leather goods...ask me again I'll still tell ya you should.\n\nCan you dig it?"
0,"Wow. What can I say? Everyone else gave them 5 stars, but I thought they were terrible. The man who helped me had such poor English, I couldn't understand him. What I could understand was that he wouldn't repair my purse-said it was unfixable. I have a white leather purse that got some blue ink on the outside; a simple fix accomplished by re-dying it white. He wouldn't do it. So I went to the Shoe Shop at 39th St. And Camelback. He fixed it in 3 days. For $35, he not only fixed the ink issue, but he shampooed the inside and Scotch guarded the inside AND outside. I'd say The Shoe Shop is the better way to go."
4,"I have been bringing my shoes for years. This man knows what he's doing! I can't rave enough about this place, I tell all of my friends to go here, just like I'm telling you! You wont be sorry!"
4,I took two pairs of shoes in to Express ShoeRepair and was extremely impressed with both the workmanship and the price. They were able to repair a pair of puppy chewed boots as well my husbands well used cycling shoes. I totally recommend to anyone looking for a great local cobbler!
4,"I've used these guys twice and just about to take more stuff in for service. Prices are good. The services is fast and covers everything from shoes to luggage. Convenient hours. They are also open till 7PM, not 6PM as stated here on Yelp. Pay with cash: may get a better deal."
2,"Im really torn on this one....they do a fantastic job....and one of the few places in the valley that will polish white golf shoes....here is my issue....took multiple shoes including golf shoes there about once a month for 6-7 months....i was in a huge hurry when i picked them up and wasn't paying attention....they normally charged $8 a pair for regular shoes and around $10 for golf shoes,...they charged me $50 for 2 pair of golf shoes....i was shocked....i should have called and complained but I'm more the type to just go elsewhere....which admittedly is dumb on my part because they did do a great job polishing my shoes."
4,"Had my boots \""re-tipped\"" here.  Fast, friendly, and my boots look like brand new!  Will be back!"
1,"OK This is usually where I go for a car wash because it's convenient.\n\nNO matter how many times I tell them not to mess with seat position they always do! \nAlso they never lock my floor mats back down after vacuuming??? \nI don't get it ,they know they unlocked them and moved them around ,why don't they have the decency to lock them back into place?\n\nAnd my car is really never clean enough either, Why do I still waste my money you ask............... Well I'm not gonna wash the damn thing!\n\n2* and half stars"
1,"I have to agree with you Sarah. I question why I still go here even after everytime I leave my car is scratched up. Sure it's cleaner than when I brought it in, but not as clean as it should be. \nI'm too lazy to wash my own car too."
2,"Tried several car wash places around Ahwatukee and West Chandler, liked this place the best. Never had any of the problems the other Yelpers mentioned - no scratches, no changing seat positions or unlocked floor mats. But then I drive a Jeep, so it's kind of scratched up already (desert pin-striping, I think they call it - from the tree branches on mountain trails), the seats only really have a couple positions available, and I don't even have floor mats anymore). I do have a few after factory items, like a big ol' bumper with fog lights, which some places won't let me send through the automated wash, but these guys have never given me a problem. They won't let it go through when I've had the roof rack on though, but no other place has, either. Prices seem reasonable - there are a few different packages available, including a hand wax. Beware some of the scents they offer - I find them overpowering. Employees are hit and miss, some definitely more courteous than others. And they've got a frequent customer punch card that'll get you a free wash on your 10th visit."
2,"Like the others, I come here for convenience and that's about it. I wouldn't use the word friendly, but the people are not rude, so that's a good thing. Decent size shop, windows to watch the car being washed, TV's, drinks, ice cream, greeting cards, the usual car wash stuff. I think it is a little over priced, but then again I don't always (or ever) feel like vaccuming my own car, so I pay someone else to do it. My car has never been scratched, if that happened to me, I would probably not be as likely to come back."
1,"This is in a good simple location.  After working full time, a baby, and all of the other life things...sometimes I just don't have the energy to wash my own car.  The last time I was here I they removed my custom chevy bowtie antenna (which was fine) however at the finishing area they had put it on completly sideways.  I had asked one of the employees if he had the wrench to tighten it and straighten it (since they did take it off)  he did not speak one word of english so I gestured with my had I wanted it straight.  He grabbed it with his hands and started twisting it.  I did tell him no several times progressively louder, but either the lack of english or him being smarter than me in that matter he continued.  Just as I was reaching up to stop him, he snapped my custom bowtie antenna in half.  No, they didn't offer to fix it, or even give me a free wash or two.."
1,"\""Meh\"" across the board. It's a \""meh\"" smorgasbord, if I may be so bold.\n\nThey vacuum the car, but neglect to vacuum any hard-to-reach spots. So, your floorboards will be clean but you'll still have french fries stuck between your seats.\n\nThey send the car through an automatic wash. Yawn.\n\nThey put your car through the \""finishing\"" routine where people definitely appear to be working hard to scrub off bugs, clean the rims, polish the windows, and so on. Don't let them fool you--they're moving a lot, but they're not working that hard.\n\nA spot inspection of your car may not reveal any obvious issues, but once you're five blocks away, you'll start to notice the windshield is streaked, there are crumbs in the leather wrap around your shift knob, and so on. Basically your car passes the squint test, but it doesn't hold up to any kind of scrutiny.\n\nPay the 10-year-old kid on your block $5 to wash your car and you'll get about the same result."
0,The other reviews are pretty accurate.  These guys don't take the time to do anything more than push the dirt around.  Definitely won't be going back here.
0,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I decided to spend my money here. I spent 54.99 on getting my car washed and cleaned inside and out. There was still stuff on my floor boards, they didn't even clean the dash or anything else inside the car. They didn't wash the rims, I still had dirt under my spoiler. 54 bucks wasted!! I could have done 10 times a better job by myself than all 5 of them that did it!"
2,"Is your car dirty?  These guys will wash it for a fair price.\n\nI've gotten special #1 before and special #3.  I can't tell the difference and still noticed things they missed after getting the special #3.  Stick with special #1.\n\nIt's not going to be perfect.  They'll get the dirt off, it'll look shiny and clean for the most part, but if you pay very close attention to detail, you'll see that there is none.  There are water spots left over, some cleaner left in crevices, etc...\n\nBottom line, it's a basic wash for a basic price."
0,This car wash is mediocre at best. I asked them specifically not to spray my dash and they did any way. A friend of mine got pushed into fixing his windshield by the vultures who hang there. They did absolutely nothing but tried to bill his insurance for $60.  Luckily he was able to cancel it with the insurance. The car wash was gets a cut from these guys. They are nothing but crooks. I am staying away from both of them
1,"I've been here twice.  The people are very friendly, and that counts for something, but the actual quality of the wash is somewhere between 'Not good' and 'Unacceptable'.  I have a sports car, and both times I've come, I've asked for a hand wash, and both times the guy at the entry said something to the effect of \""Hey man - let's just run it through the machine.  I promise it won't hurt it!\"" which was true - it didn't hurt it, but it also didn't really do a good job of washing it either.\n\nIf it's convenient to stop here, go ahead - I don't think you're in danger.  But if you want a good car wash, this ain't it."
0,"Decent car wash, but they have someone from a windshield replacement company on site that tried to scam my 78 year old mother into replacing her windshield. They even went as far as calling Allsate insurance for her and stared a claim. When the adjuster inspected my mom's car he told her that the chip in here windshield was to small to even require sealing and rejected the claim. When my mother told  the replacement company about this they said \""that's OK you can pay cash for the replacement\"". And she firmly told them NO and they still keep calling her. Stay away from this place!!!!"
1,Please be careful here... They scratched my car and I thought the interior cleaning was poor. They seem to rush the car wash process. I'd look somewhere else.
0,"Service here has went to crap. Ised to be the best place to get your car washed. Got the $25 #3.... Had to remind them about tire dressing, and my Jeep is still very dirty. Save your $$$$. Go somewhere else"
4,I don't understand the negativity on some reviews of this place. It was super quick efficient and overall thorough. I recommend this place to anyone who is questionable.
4,"Nigiri sushi, this is usually why we go and have sushi. This places nigiri is amazing. The finest cuts of fish, the best edamami (if that is how it's spelled,) and the greatest service. \n\nI know that it is in a lackluster mall. There is not a huge air of pretension surrounding this place. And it is definitely not trying to \""keep up with the Joneses.\"" This is EXACTLY why I love this place!"
1,"I found this sushi to be painfully mediocre.\n\nStandard menu with average roll options... quality was poor, in that my boyfriend ended up on the pot for an entire evening immediatly after consuming Uni at this establishment...."
0,"This is the worst Sushi restaurant. I guess I never learn because they gave me food poisoning more than once from the eel.\n\nDon't get adventurous here because they'll make you hate all the good stuff that you would enjoy otherwise. One such example is their uni which is not fresh and served in too large a portion.\n\nThe service is also terrible. They have a lame attitude and last time I got the caterpillar roll, I told the waiter that it tasted bad so he laughed and walked away not offering to exchange it. I ended up paying for it with part of his tip.\n\nTheir rolls are humongous so if you're a glutton who doesn't care about taste, this could be your sushi place. Most rolls contain lots of fake crab."
0,"I agree with Dan.\nI'm not a fan.  \n\nThis maybe a good place for a sushi novice, as many of their rolls to contain Krab!"
3,"Totally good! Tasty food. Great unobtrusive service. 50c appetizer if you buy a Kirian beer. Very, very good overall!\n\nMinus one * for way too kiddy atmosphere. They were EVERYWHERE!! Like OMFG, just keep families with children in like one side of the restaurant or something."
0,"I will just say that when you find a good Sushi place, stick too it! I am not a big fan of trying new places when you already have been somewhere amazing! I will also not return, the best thing I had was the deep-fried crunchy eel roll....when they can't get a spicy tuna roll right...it can't be good!\nIf you are looking for an amazing place, and are in the north scottsdale area, check out Fusion Sushi: http://www.yelp.com/biz/fusion-sushi-and-china-bistro-scottsdale"
4,"This place is STILL my all time favorite place to go for EXCELLENT sushi with a GREAT atmosphere.  The sushi chefs of San Francisco, Miami and Northern Virginia need to come here and learn a thing or two about quality and price.  ARIGATO!!!\n\nI just had lunch here the other day (9-9-09) and the quality is still the best I've ever had anywhere."
3,"I enjoyed Sakana very much!  I happened to stumble upon Sakana during happy hour while out searching for a new mom & pop joint to have dinner at on a Sunday evening.  The place was lively and the sushi that kept passing by me looked amazing!  There were some pretty good deals for happy hour including appetizers for 50 cents with the purchase of a Kirin.  We ordered a few rolls including the Miami roll which was one of their special rolls of the evening.  The rolls were ok, standard fancy pants rolls.  I guess for my personal taste with sushi, less is more.....I tend to appreciate the more simple sushi in which the taste of the fish itself really shines.  For this reason, I really enjoyed their yellowtail sashimi above all else.  The presentation of everything was very nice and the sushi chefs made the ambiance very fun and authentic as they took shots with some sushi bar diners.  I would definitely visit Sakana again, especially for their sashimi."
3,Very good and high quality sushi. I ventured there based on the helpful advice of the Yelp community and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the sashimi deluxe lunch which contained lovely pieces of fuji albacore...very good!\n\nThe place was very clean and the staff quite friendly and helpful.  I'll definitely go back.
1,"Tonight was my second visit to Sakana. My first visit was for the lunch sushi special. More sushi than I could eat, for 10 bucks. Although the Cali roles were outstanding, the other pieces were average. Tonight I stopped in for Cali rolls, unagi, and edamame. The Cali rolls looked and tasted like they had been made 30 minutes before I arrived. The Unagi was outstanding! Huge pieces of eel, served warmed, tasty and filling. Service kinda sucked, waited a long time for a drink refil. Overall, average. Will return for sushi lunch special."
3,"OMFG, I love sushi!\n\nSushi bar with TVs, regular dining area, and a section setup for Teppanyaki.\n\nIt's great sushi at a great price."
1,"I have been here once before today and thought it was OK. \n\nKnowing that have a huge daily special for only $10 I thought it would be perfect to share with my daughter, I think it comes with 5 pieces of assorted sushi fish, a crunchy California roll, crab tempura and a stuffed shrimp egg roll thing plus soup and salad, definitely a lot of food! \n\nThat's what we planned on ordering until we sat down at the sushi bar and saw them pre-making the CA rolls and setting them off to the side on a large tray...UGH you know how I HATE pre made stuff! \n\nI decided on a tuna/avocado roll and Val got a shrimp tempura roll, I also ordered a cucumber salad. \n\nWell I'm much more for quality over quantity and Sakana seems to be the other way around, yeah they give you a lot but it's really not that great. \n\nMy tuna roll was OK, the Shrimp tempura roll was filled with an enormous amount of mayonnaisey Krab meat and my cucumber salad was a giant bowl, probably 3 cucumbers worth, of just plain cucumbers WTH? \n\nI tried to explain to the guy making the sushi but he didn't understand my English because he spoke mainly Spanish and I don't think the waitress understood to clearly either when she returned to me with another bowl of less amount and less fresh cucumbers, plain again but with a drizzle of something foul. \n\nThere is much much better sushi to be had and I'm more than happy to pay for it elsewhere because Sakana's sushi isn't quality sushi to my standards. \n\nBut if your looking to fill up on mediocrity by all means pull up a chair."
1,"Plus: The uni was quite good. I'm a recent convert to the Way of the Uni, so I had high hopes based on my first tastes. But in the end, the rest of the meal was just... meh.\n\nI'm a sucker for Spider rolls. But this one was over-powered by the addition of some odd crab meat mix. It wasn't bad, but it sure didn't have the flavor of soft-shell crab.\n\nMy wife had the Crunch Eel roll. It's a variation of something she gets as her standard order. Because the ingredients tend to be different from spot to spot, it's always fun to see each establishment's take on her favorite. In Sakana's case, they go much heavier on the batter, developing a product that's, well... hard. The \""eel sauce\"" was heavier on the eel than the sugar. To me, that's a matter of taste. These guys want more eel, she wants it sweeter. That's OK. Just a mismatch in expectations.\n\nShe also had some unagi nigiri. Her comment: not very flavorful. But I chalk up at least some of this to the sauce, as that didn't resonate with her.\n\nBut as luck would have it, some friends have invited us _back_ tonight. They claim it's one of their favorite places. So maybe we just ordered wrong. At any rate, we'll try that again. Maybe the teppanyaki is better than the rolls, or that the sashimi will be sublime?"
3,"Now, I like happy hour as much as the next person, probably more, but sometimes I am just not in the mood for loud music, surrounded by a bunch of beautiful people, in a trendy setting. When I'm looking for something a little more reserved and I want good sushi, I go to Sakana.\n\nThe portions are VERY generous, the atmosphere is quiet and cozy, the staff is happy and friendly and the focus is on good food, not a cool image. \n\nWhile it appears they don't have a \""happy hour\"" at Sakana, they do have a special \""Customer Appreciation\"" menu (Mon-Thur) with discounted prices on the most popular rolls. Plus, last night when we went, there was a special of \""order a Kirin or Kirin Light and get an appetizer for 50 cents.\"" What a deal!\n\nAlso, this is a great place to go with a group because of the Teppanyaki Grill tables, and that is always a fun time! Sakana is one of Ahwatukee's best kept secrets for true sushi lovers!"
2,"I went in with fairly neutral expectations, ready to be wow-ed or very disappointed. Sakana is mediocre--some things done well, others not. Our waitress, although thorough and attentive, made me feel really rushed. The 50 cent appetizer deal is awesome, and the fried scallops are great! (I love all things fried--their 50 cent appetizer menu is awesome for other fried food fanatics). The sushi tasted pretty good, but felt a bit soggy and fell apart. The teppanyaki steak was absolutely delicious, but the chef did not do any tricks or anything interesting. He just chopped up our food, cooked it, and calmly placed it on our plates. I'm used to flames and excitement when I go to a teppanyaki place. Their birthday song is pretty funny--a loud drum, a Japanese birthday song, ice cream, and a Good Fortune cat are enough to embarass almost anyone! All in all, decent food but mediocre service. I'll probably do take out if I bother with this place again."
2,"I actually give this place a 3.5 rating. If you don't mind sacrificing a little on quality for good prices Sakana is your place. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the fish here. I like this place. It is a good value for your money. The atmosphere is laid back and a good place to hang out with friends. The service is OK, but it lacks the ambience that the staff at the Gilbert location give. But, like I said I still like this location and will visit it often."
1,"This is a super \""loc\"" spot and it's usually hustling and bustling.  Nice that the neighborhood sushi fiends are so loyal.  Fortunately, Sakana is not in my neighborhood so I don't have to feel bad about not liking it.  The menu is just average, both on paper and on plate.  The service is a lot like servicing yourself- leaves a lot to be desired."
0,"They have a very limited menu, horrible service, and a really pushy staff. I'm sure there are better places out there for cheaper."
0,THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE! The service is the worst you will get at any Sushi place I've been to. I went for lunch one day and ended waiting over an hour to get my meal and the bill. Our waitress never came back once to refill our sodas or anything. The staff was rude when we reminded them that the bill needed to be split. NEVER AGAIN!
2,"Why, oh, why is Teppanyaki such a challenge!?!  It is the ultimate in party cuisine and a great experience, plus the food seems that much better cooked in front of you.  Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan restaurant.\n\nMy nephew is an Asian food junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great experience and Sakana remained one of two places in town we have not tried so onward...\n\nWe were sat immediately about 15 minutes prior to our reservation and quickly ordered drinks and sushi.  After reading other reviews I walked over to the sushi bar and looked at the day's specials.  We ordered two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy tuna roll.  There was nothing wrong with any of it.  The sushi had a clean taste and was very good.  It was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe teppan started with a decent soup and salad.  The show itself was good, not great.  The portions of the meats were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The rice was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was that the rice and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the meats and the shrimp were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's steak as Teppan steak I always feel has the best flavor for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it tasted like typical steak.\n\nSo basically the whole food experience was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the service.  Lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind.    My sister said she felt she bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of items I mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  I had to ask to get water and tea refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.  It took a good 15 minutes for my sister's beverage to come from the bar.  It was almost an hour before the teppan chef came over.  \n\nThe server though was personable enough that the non-service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice."
3,"We go to Sakana on a regular basis. We usually only order sushi. For the price, location, and quality and quantity of the sushi, we really like Sakana."
3,"This place gets packed for lunch to get there before noon!  We were quickly seated and then our server got our drink orders.  The green ice tea is right on.  The real stuff!!  I got the #4 Chicken Cutlet (Panko Fried Chicken with Tonkatsu sauce).  Most lunches are served with Miso soup, salad and rice.  I got everything of the lunch except for the rice.  I thought the lunch did not come with rice so I just eat what I got, until I looked it up on the website.  HUM?  Either way, the service was great, food was great, and the prices are reasonable!!!"
3,"Coming from California you can feel my snub towards desert sushi.  Also while visiting Arizona a while back was the first time I've ever had BAD sushi. BUT-how much longer could I have avoided such sushi cravings I've been having since I moved here? I need sushi in my life...\n\nAMBIANCE: \nIts interesting how sushi houses in Phoenix take orders by having a paper menu which the party can mark themselves. (Highly efficient btw.) \nLocated in a random shopping center, Sakana has a comfortable atmosphere with a little more real estate than you would figure this spot to be from the outside. Family & hip(ster-ish) oriented (patrons & servers alike) instead of the familiar K-pop cover ballads they played some 90's pop hits from MJ to Prince. Nothing like your 'HE HEEE'S!' & purple rain while you're scarfing down some good fish. Its casual.\n\nSUSHI & SERVICE: \nI went with a party of 5 on a Sunday with most of the tables occupied. Even so I was surprised we got our drinks & smoked salmon sashimi  within 5 minutes. We sampled 6 different rolls-from baked scallop to the tootsie roll to the fried Californian. All which I should say is pretty LEGIT. Not the straight out the water fresh but the THIS-IS-AS-GOOD-AS-IT-CAN-GET-SUSHI- WISE-OUT-HERE fresh. Which is all I can ask for! Really, it was DELICIOSO. \n-The rolls are your standard size for (Americanized) sushi about 4-6 pieces.\n-If you ever order the baked scallop roll they bless it with an abundance of crab meat/chopped up scallops & topped off with sprinkled fish eggs-no room for dissapointment here. \n\nThough Sakana has 2 other locations in the valley it does not have the flavor of 'chain' sushi. Also they mixed up an order of a massive sushi plater & placed it on our table then had to quickly take it back right when my cousin was about to pinch one with her chopsticks. Well 2 minutes later we were served a plate of another Vegas roll-on the house. To compensate for the possible emotional distress you may have caused taking away  that triple roll platter-compensate you did. NOTED.\n\nBRAVO Sakana for your timely & friendly service, being open on sunday & the complimentary sushi. I shall return to this sushi house in the desert! Finally a place for my sushi fix."
4,"I HEART Sakana, I have been going to Sakana since my 16 year old was in a high chair. It is by far the best restaurant in Ahwatukee and the best sushi to get in Phoenix. \nIf you need something to do with valley visitors take them to Sakana for the sushi & Tepan tables. \nPrice is fair, they do have a happy hour menu so one can try new things.... \nGO FOR IT!"
0,"I wanted to like this place, but honestly only because of the sushi chef Ramon, who was flirting with me while I was dining solo after work and even tried to give me free food (cooked salmon ribs). Unfortunately, I got puking sick immediately after leaving this place and considering I only had 2 drinks and I'm not a lightweight, I can only blame the sushi. I suppose I should have known something was up when the yellowtail didn't have that signature taste I love so much and the salmon seemed to have a filmy texture but as I said, Ramon made me want to like this place. The portions were huge but in addition to my horrible aftermath, I found the selection of fish and rolls to be limited (no bluefin toro or shiro maguro) and my waitress was very inattentive.\n\nI'm sorry Ramon but I will not be coming back to see you."
2,"I was disappointed in Sakana, mainly because of the service.\n\nThe food was excellent, and wonderfully priced. I think I ate a week's worth of sushi for $25. But the service!\n\nIt took us a while to be seated. When we were seated, it took several minutes for us to get drinks. I ordered edamame and the waitress forgot about it. After 25 minutes, I had to remind her. She apologized and brought the appetizer and THEN got our order. We waited another 45 minutes to get our sushi. When the sushi arrived, it was incorrect. She had brought another table our order and their order to our table. Another 15 minutes of waiting to get our order re-made, and we finally got to eat. We arrived at 7pm and left around 9:30pm. \n\nAgain, the quality of the sushi was great. I enjoyed the rolls and the prices were excellent.\n\nI'd give Sakana another chance, in hopes that the waitress was new or training."
1,"Meh. Service was not very quick but it was friendly. The sushi was decently priced but seemed uninspired and was not particularly fresh. The spring rolls were strange to say the least, mushy inside with a fried doughy shell instead of the usual flaky shell. Not worth the trip in our opinion."
0,"This place is so BAD!! Seated right away, with reservations, poor quality of food and the service matched.  Such a let down...chef had zero personality and the food matched.  Cheap drinks and appetizers was all that was a positive."
1,I was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews. Not a good first experience. First we had to wait 30 minutes for our food and got 5 different rolls to share.  There was so much mayo in the crab it left a coating in my mouth (YUK!)  The Phili roll was warm including the cream cheese.  The only good thing was the bartender.  I might go back to try the tepen grill but won't be getting sushi from here again.
3,"Great Food, Great price, Great Atmosphere... \n\nHad a Large kirin, with 99c appetizer mushrooms.. best fried mushrooms i have had in a long long time.. California Rolls and Alaska Rolls also on this trip.. Very good, and FRESH...\n\nWife - Teriyaki Chicken,, very good even though all places only sell breast meat on chicken entrees... Portion size was huge comparative to the lunch pricing..\n\nI had the Calamari Jalapeno salad,, lots of Calamari, seriously was more Calamari than salad,, the dressing is unique and matches very well to the dish.\n\nIced Tea was definitely not china mist or nestle, or lipton,   very good also.\n\n2 appetizers with beer, and 2 full entree's for about 30 bucks out the door.. simply great.... Will definitely be back,, often\n\nThanks!!"
3,"Found a new lunch spot oh yea! Went with some coworkers on a Friday at high noon, guess what yall the place was packed, but we waited about 5 mins and then got seated. Right when you walk in you can see on the counter what the lunch specials are, and I knew before I was seated what I wanted! \nI ordered the Sakana lunch special which was delish! It had rolls, jalapeno stuff crab popper things, tuna, salmon and other fish, came with soup & salad and was 10 bucks!! TEN BUCKS YALL!!! OMG it was delish! I know normally I would not be able to get all that for ten bucks!  \nSushi was fresh and great tasting, service was kinda slow, but it was a very busy Friday lunch rush! I am glad to have found them and to add them to my many lunch spots stops! \nI will be back!"
4,"My friends and I have been coming here for about a year; we have dubbed our Tuesdays \""Sushi Tuesdays,\"" and will continue to give patronage for many more years. If you are looking for great food and great service this is the place to come, its like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert. You could go to one of the many run of the mill sushi joints around town but you would be missing out on what life truly has to offer.\n\nAs previous reviews have stated, there are excellent appetizer specials when you purchase a Japanese beer such as fried calamari, chicken yakitori, edemame and of course pot stickers (fried or steamed) for $1.\n\nMy favorite dinner item is the big eye tuna, they cut a piece right behind the cheek or gill of the fish and call it the big eye kama. The meat is extremely tender and ample, like having a steak except incredibly nutritious. The fish is served with a sweet sauce which is delicious and when eaten with Kirin Light it creates a perfect pair, just ask for it you will not be disappointed. Rolls are excellent as well, some of my favorites would be the Cajun wild fish roll or the crunchy eel roll. The sashimi is always made fresh and promptly, the shrimp, salmon and eel are some of the tasty items I enjoy.\n\nThe Bartender Wes keeps everyone quenched and always has positive energy. Management likes to interact with their guests to ensure satisfaction with all orders, which equals great customer service. \n\nThank you Jun, Taki and April."
4,Great lunch specials! The best green tea ever! Love this place. Always great fast service.
4,Love this place!!!! Great FRESH  sushi!
4,It's is the place for sushi in Tempe and south Phoenix. It's priced fair and the fish is so fresh. This is the only place I suggest for sushi in this corner of phoenix.
4,"We had a fun meal here!  My friends had the teppan meal and shared with me...very tasty, and fun to watch the chef - he was very entertaining!  I checked in with Yelp and received edamame at no charge.  I ordered California Roll and Salmon sushi, which was fresh and tasty.  The staff was friendly and service was excellent.  I chose it based on what I read on Yelp, and was not disappointed!"
0,"Ridiculous. I have had better fresher sushi from a supermarket. The place is overpriced and completely poor quality. Pretty sure they gave us canned tuna and canned crab soaked in mayo. The service is a joke. It took forever to place an order, the woman next to us had to flag down a waitress to even get a drink order and she was there longer than us. The servers checked on us once after we received our food. We literally waited more than  20 minutes to get the check and another ten to get my card back. \n\nThe rolls are so oversize and we did not even get a plate to put our rolls down. I am pretty sure most of these reviews are fake or these people have never had semi-decent sushi. The rolls were just a huge mess and fell apart if you tried to move them. Each bite of sushi here was equivalent of three bites of normal sushi. I was really excited because this place had such amazing reviews. I just wasted 40+ dollars on a terrible experience. I should have just gone to a supermarket or gas station, because at least they are honest about ripping me off."
0,"Service: Seated promptly in the booth section but was left along with several other patrons at different booths to find our own service after waiting over 4 minutes. Once we got the attention of a server, we placed our order for the lunch special rolls. Even though this place was very busy (~12:30pm with lots of business lunch patrons), you could watch as some servers stood around not doing anything. Rolls came out at a reasonable pace but we weren't even given a small plate to eat each piece off of and had to eat over our roll plates. We were only checked on once (not by our original server) and that was because she was resting her elbow on the booth section divider and casually asked us if everything was good. When we were done eating we waited for at least 5 minutes to see if they would bring a check, then we started making eye contact with servers hoping they would get the point but they would continue with whatever they were doing. We had to flag someone down to get our check. Unacceptable level of service from start to finish.\n\nFood: You could tell how they could offer such good deals on their lunch special rolls when they overload the rolls with rice and fake crab/mayo (I have no problem with either ingredient, but they pack the rolls with it to the point where many different rolls tasted very similar because they were so dominant with the fake crab mix). Each piece was extremely large and cumbersome to eat, often falling apart before you can find a way to fit it in your mouth. The rolls weren't even in the shape of a circle, but more like a rounded triangle. The sushi chefs were either rushed, new, or incompetent. I'm also suspicious that the spicy tuna uses canned tuna as filler along with chunks of real tuna. I'll let you decide if that's acceptable for sushi.\n\nAmbiance: It's ok. You won't pay attention to it when you're trying to get a servers attention."
3,My husband loved the salmon sashimi
4,"I am almost wanting to go and un-star places I have been before, because they pale in comparison to this place.\n\nWe got 4 orders of nigiri: Salmon, more salmon, tuna, and Salmon roe -- all of them were amazing. We also got a spicy tuna roll which was fresh and delicious, and eel roll which was tangy and delightful.\n\nThe sushi was SO FRESH, I couldn't believe it. The nigiri was powerful in it's simplicity, and the rolls were incredibly well constructed and  beautifully presented. \n\nOn top of that, the wait staff here really has their shit together -- like WHOA. Nobody missed a beat, everyone was helpful, and the sushi chef's were chopping and going through order tickets like wildfire, smiling the entire time. Some guy even bought them 4 bottles of sake for their great effort, and I know it was well deserved.\n\nAmazing service. \nEven better sushi.\n\n$22 dollars. AAAAAH! I will eat here every day for the rest of my life!!!"
2,"6/30/11\n\nTook visiting family and Mom to lunch (Mom and sister's choice).  Ordered a lunch combo of nigiri and sushi (this came with soup and salad, as well) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sakana-sushi-and-grill-phoenix?select=nIsYuomKUtkrNr8vmBFeuQ#nIsYuomKUtkrNr8vmBFeuQ, chicken cutlet app http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sakana-sushi-and-grill-phoenix?select=N7xj81S16w8rHVyIJNtVAg, veggie tempura http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sakana-sushi-and-grill-phoenix?select=vRZl2Szfl5D0Np7L0GWiGg#vRZl2Szfl5D0Np7L0GWiGg, and soft shell crab roll http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sakana-sushi-and-grill-phoenix?select=RUv26rn7h0xSBDb90juw3w#RUv26rn7h0xSBDb90juw3w for everyone to share.  Extra miso soup and salads were ordered.  We enjoyed the crab roll and veggie tempura a lot, but the star was the chicken cutlet!  It was meant to be a complementing side dish for niece and nephew, who had ordered chicken teriyaki dishes for themselves, while the adults were going to have sushi, and yet, here we all were enjoyiing the cutlet.  Who knew?"
1,"I've been travelling to Phoenix for work and I've been looking for some good sushi and thought I found it here. The first time I came here the fish was fresh and the portions large and prices good.  Friendly staff, nice atmosphere.  What's not to like.  You know what?  i'm coming back.  That's right.  Probably the very same week.  \n\nWell... that was a mistake.  I sat at the same bar.  Ordered the same food.  The sushi chef was different though. Every piece of Nigiri I ate made me tear up.  I'm not always a complainer (vocally) so I didn't say anything and just assumed the chef was new and learning the ropes.  Well, the next day my stomach told me otherwise. I now realize the chef was hiding bad fish with massive amounts of wasabi. \n\nI never went back, nor will I.  Also, I eat a ton of sushi.  I'm surprised I don't have mercury poisoning.  I say that to point out that my stomach never gets upset from even decent sushi. \n\nThe second star is because it's a game of russian roulette here.  You might get lucky.  If you'd rather not play the game, go to Sushi Ken.  I've eaten at about 15 sushi joints around here.  That's the go-to spot."
1,Below average. So many other places to go. Don't waste your monry
1,"This was a very disappointing experience. The sushi was falling apart and out of the 3 rolls, 1 was at least average. The miso soup had no tofu and the spring rolls had nothing of substance inside. Not sure if the good reviews here are for the tepanyaki but the sushi was awful. I am giving 2 stars just because it was really cheap. But the sushi was really a 1-star meal."
3,"Crazy busy place with lots of \""regulars\"". It seemed like everyone was friends with the waitstaff. In fact, one of the waitresses was doing shots with a customer. Anyway, now to the food. I sat at the sushi bar since I was by myself. I had my usual which consists of Hamachi, Tuna and Unagi nigiri and a roll. The nigiri selection was fresh and tasty. The roll was a little disappointing. I can't rememer what it was called but although it was disappointing I still enjoyed my dinner and would definately return."
1,"It pains me to write this review.  I've been going to Sakana since grad school in 2007, when we'd hit up the 59th Ave. location regularly.  When I moved, I was happy to find this location was close to the house and it became my 'take-out' sushi joint.  Probably went there 20 times in the past year - mostly with called in orders, but often dragging the (non-sushi-eating) boyfriend along for a dine in.  Rolls are big and stuffed with fish, esp. for the price, and the quality is pretty good.\n\nSo what happened? 2 terrible experiences in a row.  \n\nIn May, I had a hankerin' for take-out, called in my order, and got the usual \""It'll be ready in 30 minutes.\""  Perfect.  Enough time to drive over, stop at the Safeway and get some beer before picking up the delicious yumminess.  Did that, got the sushi, paid and was halfway home when it occurred to me that there were fewer boxes than usual.  Pulled over, did a check and... sure enough, they forgot my nigiri.  Darn.\n\nCalled them up, told them what happened, and headed over to pick up my food.  (I had been charged for it, I was going to get it.)  Head to the hostess, tell her who I am, \""Oh, ok.  We'll put that order in for you.\"" Uh? You didn't already? \""You're going to expedite it, right?\"" \""Oh, of course.\""\n\nSo I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  How long does it take to make up 8 rice balls, wasabi them and plop pre-cut fish?! Talk to the hostess... it is coming? My other sushi IS sitting in the car.  \""I'll go check.\""  Ok... so I wait some more.  I've been irritated for a while now, but apparently it is becoming visible.  It has been 30(!!) minutes since my \""expedited\"" order was put in (70 minutes since my original order was phoned in).  The manager sees this and comes over, asking what is wrong.  I tell him.  To his credit, he gets the order handled and gives me a $10 coupon to come back.  Still annoyed, but mollified, I head out.\n\nFast forward to last night.  I have my coupon and a hankerin' for sushi, so wrassle up the boy and head back to give Sakana another chance.  I put our name on the list (30 minute wait) and, because it is crowded & noisy, head outside to wait.  There are several other folks out there and, periodically, the hostess comes out calling names.  Once. Twice.  Three times.  She comes out, calling names.  \n\nAfter a while, someone comes out and lights up a cigarette within smelling range (ew!!!), so the boy and I head inside to wait.  Names are called.  New people come in and get their names on the list.  More people are seated.  It can't be long now! Then the hostess goes out and fetches some of the new people, happily taking them to a table.  \n\nWTF?! The boy goes and looks at the list.  We've been crossed off.  WTFF?! Our name hadn't been called - we were in earshot the entire time; why was it crossed off? Forget this - I guess they don't want us to eat here.  So we got up and went across town to my true favorite sushi place.  (If it weren't such a long drive to Scottsdale, we'd always go there.)  Which worked out much better, since the staff recognize us, the fish is better, there is more non-sushi variety for the boy, and it is much less noisy and crowded.\n\nI'll be back to Sakana one more time.  I still have that coupon after all and $10 of sushi is $10 of sushi.  But now I'm on the prowl for a new sushi place close by to become my new \""take out\"" place.  It's too bad... I DO like them a lot, but to receive execrable service two times in a row is unacceptable."
1,I go here for the lunch and get the lunch special. It's good most of the time but real watery. I ate some bad sushi and regretted it. I probably won't come here again.
2,"I'd give Sakana a 3.5 if I could...The food was a 4, but the service was a 3.  They were busy and our server seemed new.\n\nAs always we looked on Yelp for somewhere to eat when we found ourselves on the road, away from our house, and looking for something great to eat. \n\nWe had the fried tofu (really good if you like tofu, Miso soup (hard to mess that up), edamame (free thanks to our Yelp check-in!), and an assortment of sushi that was really good.  \n\nWe will definately give Sakana another try if we end up in their part of town again."
4,"I've had a lot of sushi from a lot of places, as many others have. The difference between me and some of those people is that I've had the pleasure of visiting Sakana. In fact, after my first visit I was hooked, and have had the pleasure of visiting countless times. \n\nI'll keep it very simple and provide you the order to end all orders. Why is Sakana better than any other affordable sushi option? Quantity, quality, price...amazing service is the cherry on top. Instead of being subjective I'll focus on a more objective view. Here's what I order EVERY time with my girlfriend:\n\nDrinks $14: Large Kirin and sake x2 \nAppetizers $2 ($1 each with Kirin purchase!):\n\nJalaccini (fried zucchini and jalapeno)\nFried mushrooms (best you'll ever have)\nBoth come with \""miso mayo\"" the greatest sauce I've ever tasted!\n\nSushi $7.65:\n\nSpicy tuna roll (the biggest roll you will find, bar none. I kid you. not, these things are stuffed full of tuna)\n\nMexican Caliente roll (jalapeno goodness, just as gigantic as the spicy tuna!)\n\nGrand total for 2 sake bombs, 2 apps, and 2 giant rolls:\n \n$23.65 + $5 tip\n\nThis is the best of the best, and for a price that can't be beat. Oh and here's a bonus: they have gluten free soy sauce! \n\nOther tips: ask for the happy hour cocktail menu, they don't have it out, but most of the drinks are incredible and affordable."
1,"I don't understand the good reviews for this place.\nI gave this place two tries.  Went with my boyfriend for lunch and it was okay for the price, not great.. but decent.\nWe thought dinner would be better, a lot of sushi places don't exactly shine for lunch.  We judge a place based on the nigiri.  It just wasn't that... great... it wasn't that fresh, wasn't that flavorful.. just not up to par at all.  We took people there for a business meeting and the people that are just used to tempura and California rolls seemed happy.  \nBasically.. cheap rolls and tempura.. okay for lunch.\nIf you are a sushi snob, find somewhere that showcases the fish more. \nOh! And this place plays 90's pop music loudly.  Weird."
3,"Solid sushi place with multiple locations. Great value for the happy menu items. The place filled up just a few minutes after opening at 11 am, which is a good sign. Free miso soup upon sitting down and free edamame with a yelp check in. I thought they were a little undercooked though.  Buy a large bottle of Kirin and get a 99cent appetizer. We had fried calamari with jalape\u00f1os which were great and came with a nice dipping sauce.  We also ordered two rolls off the \""happy hour\"" menu. Very nice fish:rice ratio. Some places jipp you with a lot of rice and little fish.  We also ordered the sakana sushi special. Needless to say, we ordered too much food with our hungry eyes.  The sushi fish itself was ok. I felt that it was room temperature instead of cold and straight out of refrigerator. Not fishy yet but just about to go under.  Slices are decent size, but some cuts were a bit sloppy. Total bill was less than $30 and that includes a few glasses of beer.  Would've been perfect if our third party member went to the right location...Double check where you'll be eating at!"
2,"*I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, gaaah! So let's just say, 3.5.*\n\nMet Monica O. and Preston S. here for lunch a couple of months back.\n\nKind of cramped atmosphere, and the d\u00e9cor is interesting to say the least. Like someone couldn't choose a theme. But, that adds character! \n\nI had heard great things about the Sakana Lunch ($10). \n\nYou get miso soup, a small salad, six nigiri pieces, your typical crunchy-saucy California-esque roll and a crunchy crab jalape\u00f1o popper roll. \n\nDid I mention this was all for $10? So much food! Couldn't even finish mine. \n\nThe miso soup was meh, but really enjoyed the ginger dressing used on the salad. \n\nIs it the freshest sushi in the world? Definitely not. But you have to remember, this is Arizona. At least it didn't seem suspect. \n\nService is friendly, yet a bit on the slow side, so wouldn't recommend Sakana if you're tight on time during a workday lunch. I likely won't come back for lunch as my work falls into the \""nearby, but not so nearby\"" when you throw in the time factor. \n\nIs Sakana going to blow your mind? Likely not for those sushi connoisseurs out there. But I'd like to give them another try for dinner."
4,"Still the best sushi, this side of the Pecos (river, not road).\n\nThis is my go to sushi place, each time I ride into town.  Sometimes I'll eat here several times before hitting the road again.\n\nOne thing I noticed this time around, was that many of their \""happy hour\"" sushi specials, seem to all be a variation of a California roll.  Hmmm?  As good as this place is, I don't see the need for such creative increased profit margin tactics.\n\nOh well, I just won't order those items on my next visit, which won't be soon enough."
1,"Terrible hostess, doesn't have communication with guests, isn't respectful or friendly and ignore customers"
0,"I'm a big sushi fan and not incredibly picky, but this experience was very odd. The Yelp reviews were good so we went. They were busy when we got there so we waited a bit which wasn't terrible but consistently the service was slow and another waitress had to basically take over our table. Worst of all, the sushi was bizarre. I ordered an Alaskan roll and spicy tuna and the Alaskan came out as a gigantic roll with piles of salmon and mayo-filled fake crab salad and no avocado. I appreciate the value I guess? but having the huge roll with that in it was inedible and I have never not finished a sushi roll. The spicy tuna had tons of mayo-y spicy tuna and then more fake crab mush. Our tofu tempura appetizer came out after the entrees. The music was also strange- loud 90s music. The hibachi chef clanging in the corner with a gaggle of women yelling 'woohoo!' didn't add to the experience. Not sure we'll be back."
2,"Not bad, but not great. Had a four star rating so we decided to stop by here on our way back home to LA. Unfortunately, we were a bit disappointing.. \n\nAll the smaller rolls were pretty much some variation of a California roll, which were okay but had no differentiating flavors. The boyfriend got the sashimi lunch special which was a good price but tasted pretty average. The last dish we ordered was the baked scallop roll which took foorrever to come out. I wish I could say it was worth the wait but again not much flavor. I recommend they give  a warning on the wait time for that dish.\n\nThe only upside was that the waitress and sushi chef were very nice and attentive."
1,"Went because of Valentine's Day. Won't go again. The food was ok enough but the staff was horrible. She forgot to place an order for us three different times and we kept having to ask someone else for help. Then to find out after an hour and a half of trying to get our food correct that if we wanted an extra soda there were no refills, you had to pay again. Food was ok, but not worth everything else involved."
1,"I wanted to like this place, at first. I had high hopes, mostly because the reviews were good. However, in a nutshell, service is shoddy.\n\nI was in a group of four in total - my boyfriend, myself, and his two roommates. We arrived at a particularly busy time (7:30 PM on Sunday Night, which doesn't sound like a busy time). There was a bit of a wait as they cleaned up a booth for us - however they left some things on the floor, a napkin and some crumbs on the seat - so it wasn't really as clean as I would have liked. That's just me being critical though.\n\nAnyway, on to the actual food and service.\n\nThe menu was strange, and was pretty barren. There were only two ramen options, two udon options, and four miso soup options. Entrees were mostly tempura too. There wasn't a lot to choose from if you didn't want an appetizer or sushi. \n\nI ordered a bowl of miso, a cucumber roll, an avocado roll, and a rainbow roll. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki. One roommate ordered the udon, while the other ordered the ramen.\n\nMy miso came out first, and fairly speedily. It was absolutely delicious, although I was disappointed there wasn't any tofu - however that's silly of me considering I didn't order the tofu miso. It was delicious regardless. I loved it.\n\nThen was the waiting. The udon came out second, after around 15 or 20 minutes. Then came the chicken teriyaki, which was another 5 or so minutes - the udon was already half gone at that point.\n\nThen, ten minutes later, came the ramen. The udon was nearly gone. The chicken teriyaki would have been too, but my boyfriend was eating slowly and very little as a sort of respect thing for me, since I had been waiting for my sushi for what seemed like forever.\n\nFinally, after what felt like forever, my cucumber and avocado rolls came out. I will admit that they were to die for, although a little tiny bit salty. I don't mind saltiness though! I ate most of those before my rainbow roll came out. The rainbow roll wasn't actually that great - the crab mix inside tasted too sweet, and they used way too much.\n\nThe rolls themselves were fairly big and hefty, and I got full from the cucumber and avocado, and half the rainbow roll. I was really pleased with the first two, but that rainbow roll was a little \""bleh.\"" I was actually really surprised at how the avocado tasted - it was firm, creamy, cool and very, very yummy.\n\nThroughout the night, there was in total of 4 waitresses waiting on us. It was very busy, which I completely understand, but I would have expected food to come out together rather than all separate. I had also heard complaints from my group on how dim the lighting was. \""We aren't vampires\"" was a good comment.\n\nAll in all, the food itself was very good (aside from that crab salad filling, but it might be good for other people), but the service was spotty and spread out, and it was noisy, busy, dim and not as clean as I would have liked. Me and my boyfriend's check came out to be around $40, which sounds a little steep to me, but drinks weren't included.\n\nI don't recommend this place, and I don't plan on going back, but I do commend them for their cucumber rolls."
3,"Sakana is the best sushi place I have been ever, awesome specials displayed when you walk in the door, great teppanyaki if thats your thing as well.  Get there early as there is always a line!!"
3,"Cold.  Diggity.  Damn.\n\nWho knew such a quality sushi place could be found in Phoenix of all places?\n\nAfter seeing/passing by this place a few times and getting the nod of approval from a trusted pal, I finally decided a few weeks ago to try it out!\n\n-Quality: Check\n-Taste: Check\n-Presentation: Check\n-Reasonable price/value: Check\n-Portions: CHECK\n\nYou can get 5 pieces of sashimi (tuna tataki tasted great but as far as I'm concerned - Salmon takes the gold!) or a roll (soft  shell crab roll, DO IT) for about $8.50 - $10, pretty typical - BUT, they also have a Sashimi Deluxe lunch special for $12.45.  And it comes with TWELVE PIECES OF SASHIMI!  YAYYYYYYYY\n\nIf, for some strange reason you're not a fan of sushi (what's wrong with you) the Chicken Matsuri (also available during lunch) is DELECTABLE.  It's basically an upgraded version of chicken katsu - how, you ask?  Well they glaze the crap out of it in this semi-spicy semi-sweet sauce chock full of a healthy dose of AWESOME.\n\nGrade: Sashi-Mi, Sashi-You, Sashidayyy"
3,"One of the best all round sushi places.\n\nGreat tasting special rolls (salmon dynamite is really good and different). Sushi pieces are nice as well and are what you would expect from a sushi joint.\n\nWay bigger portions and quality than other sushi places so the value and flavor are hard to beat.\n\nPlace is decent inside, dark and kinda getting old but not dirty."
2,"Their all day sushi happy hour is a smokin deal! It's not just little rolls with little flavor to them either. They have spice and everything nice on their happy hour. \n\nI usually get the Mexican roll and one of the dynamite rolls (both good). They are not stingy with their meat, you will leave feeling full yet wanting more! \n\nIs give four stars, but the atmosphere isn't the greatest. It's a place to go for fun and great deals...not to impress."
0,Extremely poor service. Couldn't comment on the food as I left after being asked to move into a small space between two parties at the bar.
3,"Yummy and great!   Awesome rolls.   The Salmon Bomber is probably one of the best rolls I have ever had, at any sushi joint, but watch out, it's spicy!"
0,"We used to love this place. Unfortunately tonight, we had the absolute worst service ever. We will not be returning."
2,"Portion size was a 5, pricing was a 5. They have a special menu which I got great deals on spicy tuna roll, philly roll, tempura roll. Even the roll from regular menu was priced right too. I gave a 3 because I thought the fish on top of my rainbow roll was too thick cut. It shouldn't be super thin but it's a thick cut. There's a great habanero spicy sauce but they need to use it as accent. It was drowning the roll. So I can't really say if the sushi tasted fresh or not...maybe it was previously frozen. The place has potential...good lunch crowd."
2,"Giant Hand Rolls Stuffed With Fish!  This is not the highest quality sushi, but it is a bargain for the size of the rolls they are serving up.  Were talking a snow-cone full of fish.  2 hand rolls is enough to fill me up for lunch."
1,"I've been to this place many of times. The atmosphere is old and run down, the service is slow, coming from a server myself, and it takes forever for them to run credit cards. I have been over charged multiple times! The food though it always good! Save your money on alcohol though they can't makes drinks at all here. Stick to the beer."
4,"I've always had great food and good service here. Sushi bar, table, or teppan, it's all good. Items are very fresh and all have been tempting.  Something I have noticed here is that when you sit at the bar they have never given us something to sample.  Hmmm.  Maybe it's just my fading memory.\nBut overall, this place is my fave."
3,"I go there for the sushi and not the customer service. Hosts need to learn how to greet a guest and how to formally talk to them and acknowledge them, as for servers need to be more human- they don't really care for you much other than them receiving their tip. But the sushi is AMAZING! Such great prices and good portions, yummm."
4,"Great service, amazing food.  The baked scallops were delicious.  The spicy tuna and salmon were creamy and had just the right amount of heat."
4,"Whoa, get here at opening (the line is immediately long)! Best quality of fish that I've had out here. A bit pricey but completely worth every penny.\n\nI enjoy their specials. I've had the opportunity to try so many different varieties of fish (example: albacore from several different regions around the world). I even enjoyed their monk-fish liver, which is something I'm not usually into. My boyfriend loves the fish eggs and uni!"
1,"Came to Sakana in Ahwatukee tonight because we were in the area and I had a great experience at the Scottsdale location. I regret that decision.\n\nThe music was very loud for dining, the galley style dining area in which we were seated was sort of cramped and was the only access to the bathroom so my shoulders were rubbed by people's behinds three times as they passed. The waitstaff started to clean the dining room and flip the chairs as we ate, although there were at least 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant and they did not close until 10:30 (we paid our bill and left at 10:40).\n\nThis brings us to the food; I was extremely disappointed in the sushi quality. We ordered whitetail and unagi to start and the unagi was unusually fishy in flavor and was over cooked. The cut of the whitetail was generous, but not the knife skill I am used to. It was not trimmed on the thin side of the filet and wasn't a consistent thickness all the way through. \n\nAbout this time we were delivered a mug of hot green tea, which was odd because we didn't order any, were told they were bringing us another, then about one minute later a server came by and said sorry and took it from our table. This only seemed odd because when I waited tables I would never think of taking something from a table, even after serving it to the incorrect one. We then had the Roller Coaster roll and found the spicy tuna on top to be mushy and flavorless. \n\nThe best thing about the meal was the tempura calamari. It was crispy and flavorful and not greasy. I expected more based my previous experience, not sure if it was just an off night but the number of issues were off putting."
0,"Probably the worst sushi I've had in the Phoenix area. I wanted to enjoy it because of the great reviews, but the bland \""spicy\"" edamame, baked scallop roll that was basically just a mess of mayo and lump crab, the salt less/vinegar less suonomo salad, and the inedible salmon bomber roll ensures that I will never come back. The best part of the meal was that my dog could eat the edamame because they were so lacking in any seasoning."
4,"When we first got seated our server was trying to catch up and was a bit frazzled, but as a server I totally understand that feeling. We told her we weren't in a hurry and she took a deep breath and thanked us for giving her a break. Her service was very prompt and knowledgeable about the food. And the food was incredible, especially for the price point! That's not a cop out for the food but I was pleased when we received our tab. We had a great time on our anniversary dinner and will definitely return"
1,"As far as Michaels stores go, this place is awful. The floors are dirty and cluttered and the staff is very loud, like yelling across the store loud. I felt gross being here, go to Hobby Lobby instead."
3,"Quick and easy... Thank god!!!  I do make a point, however, to never come on a weekend if I can help it.  My favorite location is Tempe Marketplace because it is MUCH bigger, but for convenience sake, I'll stop by here when I need something."
1,"Understaffed. Checkout lines almost always long, staff rarely available to help. Not super clean. Will see if that improves at the new location..."
0,"Took a friend here to pick up some things he needed and I wanted to see what Rainbow Loom stuff they had.  After trying to get the attention of the 3rd employee and having to wait while they finished their conversation, I was informed that they only received about a dozen of the upgraded kits and has sold out of them a few week prior, and they weren't sure if/when they would be getting anymore in.\n\nAt the check out counter we had Ryan.  He was making jokes and really friendly with the person I brought and while replying I said one word that he didn't like.  I apologized and was trying to be friendly with him but from start to finish, he wasn't very nice to me at all.  Ryan kept rolling his eyes and was very short with me.  So I started to think that maybe he was rude because I don't look Caucasian.  Either way, he should not be working in anything customer service related."
0,This is no longer here. Boo.\nReally needed to go and it's as though it never existed!
3,i had not been inside a Chuck E Cheese for evvverrr until just a few days ago and geez it sure has changed since i was a kid!  Kids go bonkers in this place and they do a really good job of making the kids feel special and all that jazz. They have the table sections for each party and do a group birthday celebration when chuck e comes out. The birthday kids also get to go into a wind blower and try to catch a bunch of tickets.. my friends son got the $1000 ticket (only one in there) and he freaked out haha! Good place for the young kids for sure and a decently priced place to throw a bday bash so you don't break the bank.
1,"This was the first time in a couple of years I have been to a Chuck E Cheese. My son was a little too young when I went the first time. Now that he is three I decided to try again. What a great location! They have tons of games at this location. I was not a fan of the pizza the other time I went but this time it tasted really good. I ordered French fries for my kiddo and they gave a lot for just under $2. I really apprecicated their online allergy list. It is very thorough and having a kid with a gluten, dairy and rice allergy makes this very important. The salad bar looked very fresh and next time I will definitely eat that, too. The young man at the front was very polite and nice as was the young lady at the food and prize counter. While I was there, three teenage boys came in and were being a little obnoxious, not even too bad but annoying. The management asked them to leave and handled it very professionally. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I was there as they opened their doors and the games, mainly the tunnels and slide, were very dirty. I would not let my kiddo go in them because they were nasty. To their credit, I have never let him go in those because they are nasty everywhere. They must be hard to clean. Plus, the prize selection was definitely a little lacking. Besides that, love it there and will become a regular customer even though it is a 20 minute drive for me.\n\nEDIT:\nForgot to mention my son got the worst norovirus sickness ever from here and ended up in the ER twice in 2 weeks from lack of fluids. They do not clean the place. BEWARE.\nWe were there on my birthday last Saturday so we could celebrate it as a family. The place was a pit! The worst was the fact that the young man who is supposed to watch the front door, was NEVER at the front door,. A stranger could have walked out the door with my kid. Not that I ever lose sight of my son but one of the nice things about Chuck E Cheese is the system they developed with the stamps at the front door. Well, if no one is manning the front door, they are basically worthless. And again, the place was a pit. It has definitely gone downhill the last dozen times I have gone there."
1,"Why on earth would anyone come to this location?  \n\nI don't know where to begin with my issues with this establishment.  From the salad bar that needed maintenance to the restrooms.  This is a place with kids, most of the them under the age of 12, the bathrooms need to have a regular schedule for cleaning and restocking, especially on the weekends!  Kids in general are messy, but now you have a couple hundred running through a restroom, it needs to be cleaned regularly.\n\nI was so disappointed to see that the staff only appeared for the birthday party and to drop off food, but when I looked around, I only saw one person out sweeping and trying to clean up and the person at the entrance.  Other than that, I would occasionally see a person come from the back and look around and go back to the back..  You have kids running around wildly.  Everyone at work that's not cooking should be out trying to man the restaurant floor.  \n\nHand sanitizers ran out in the play area, but people working there were waking around doing nothing.\n\nI will return if a kid I know is having a party there, but I won't be eating the food."
1,"Management needs to wake up.  This location is full of lazy, slovenly, disinterested and unhappy looking employees.\n\nBathrooms need more regular maintenance as do all of the games.  Just about every game has something wrong with it.  Instead of fixing the game when I reported a problem, they just gave me a coin.  No apology and no effort to put a sign on the machine or fix it was made on any of my visits here.  You can spend $50 playing games here and not earn enough to buy anything worthwhile at the prize counter.  This place is a racket!  \n\nSalad bar is neglected, but surprisingly the pizza service has been OK the last few times I've been here.  To put that in context, the pizza is of course not good, but at least it was hot and edible.\n\n2 stars is generous and I only give it that because at least the kids have been happy.  Get a competent manager who cares and this location can be decent."
4,"I have been here several times to eat before, and have always had a great experience.  This IHOP is located off the I-10 and Ray Road.  For some reason, its listed as a Phoenix location when I consider it Awatukee.\n\nI like this place because I have always had such wonderful service here.  The waitresses are always nice to me, I'm always seated quickly, and I dont have to wait forever to get my food.  Decent selection of food night or day, and the place is open 24 hours.\n\nI know its considered a \""chain resturant\"" but honestly, I don't hold it against them. Sometimes, I think we could all use some comfort food (like I needed today) and I think this is a reliable place to get it without sacraficing service or price."
3,"What do you do Sunday morning when you do not want any eggs or serial for breakfast? Well, we go to IHOP! And so we did this Sunday. Its 8:30am, there are ton of free tables and we get seated right away. Ohh wait! Its our server's 1st day!! OMG Horror! But, hey, you know what - kid was great! He did all just right and did not screwed up once! Kudos to you David! \nSo, anyhow. Pancakes were good. Coffee was warm and OJ was fresh. There were no hairs in my plate nor weird stains on my spoon. What else can anyone expect from IHOP? \n\n4 stars! If you wanna huge portion of pancakes go to IHOP, they got that!\n\n\""I like\"""
3,"This IHOP is always busy and for a good reason. They move people in and out quickly and the food is pretty tasty. After a 5 mile walk for cancer, the two x two x two (2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, 2 buttermilk pancakes) was excellent. They use real egg whites instead of subs, the pancakes melt in your mouth, and the bacon was delish. I added hashbrowns to top it off with hot tea. Breakfast is served!"
1,"I seem to always get unlucky here and end up with a server that disappears for long periods of time. The food isn't bad, but it's really kind of hard to screw up mostly serving breakfast items, so that's not really saying a lot. If you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning, be prepared to wait a long time if they're busy. It's not worth the wait."
1,"just had a latenight dinner at IHOP....first of all you must lower ALL expectations when going into IHOP around 11, 12, 1 at night and anytime into the wee hours of the night. First we get sat, waited a good 10min before our server showed up. I ordered CHICKEN STRIPS & FRIES. my gf got the 2x2x2. We waited another 20min or so to get our food. Of course what does she bring me, a chicken quesadilla. LOL oh yea that's right i forgot to clarify with my server that when i said chicken strips and fries, i really mean chicken strips and fries! Not a crappy quesadilla. She didnt come by our table for another 10min, and by then i didnt want to wait another 15-20min for my correct order to come out so i made due with the junk infront of me. Yea it was junk, scraps of chicken that looked like it was microwaved or something, with tomatoes and cheese. One of the 4-5 slices didnt even have the crappy chicken in it!?!?!! LOL\nso.....idk like i said, you must lower ALL of your expectations when you go to IHOP this late, especially if you're not ordering breakfast items. So i guess in a way this is my fault for not expecting even worse.......but don't get me wrong, IHOP is good for breakfast, and i'd normally give it 4-4.5 stars"
1,"This IHOP has a lot of opportunity to make up. They've been working at it, but the last few times I've been here, they have either been short staffed or too busy that we would be sitting at the table idly waiting for our food or the check or a straw."
1,"Not bad at all, but the omelets and pancakes are better at Crackers."
1,"The food was okay, the service was terrible.  Our waitress came over took our order then she went outside..for like 20 minutes. Meanwhile I could see our food sitting in the \""pick up window\"" under the heat lamp..for like 10+ minutes. I was wondering why  the other waiter with one table wasn't just bringing it to us...it was like 3pm so the place was dead. Eventually I asked him to bring it to us, geeesh. Eventually our waitress came back then asked us how our food was then sat in the back corner and talked. Didn't come back for refills and didn't come to take our dirty plates even though she kept looking over at our table. Super disappointing."
0,I took 2 of my boys here for a daddy/son date. It was hideous. The mac and cheese looked old. My corned beef hash looked like it was right out of the can. The pancakes looked decent. The water tasted horribe. When I mentioned it they said it was because it was an old building. It is mass produced food you can make at home cheaper and better. I would suggest finding a better option.
4,I'm a regular here. Love to order the fit mushroom omelette and steal a pancake or two from the hubby. The strawberry syrup is a favorite and I loveeee to eat my pancakes slowly while enjoying a nice cup of coffee.
3,"I always love an IHOP breakfast for the mix of sweet and savory options for an affordable price. I prefer IHOP to Denny's because it seems like it's less sticky, mostly.  But it's also a more expansive menu.\n\nI usually get stuffed french toast or some flavored pancakes with the eggs, bacon and hash browns.  On this particular occasion I ordered the red velvet pancakes.  Our server returned to inform me they were out, and she was so apologetic.  When we settled on a compromise of the cinnamon roll pancakes, she offered milk to go with it for the inconvenience (for the record, the cinnamon roll pancakes were good, but they were no red velvet).  She was as sweet as the pancakes, and courteous from start to finish.  \n\nThey almost always get \""over medium\"" eggs right, and they have turkey bacon which is awesome!"
0,"Horrible service. Don't waste your time. 3 separate times at this location, waited over an hour for food. On all 3 visits we walked out, it's like our server brought our drinks and forgot us. We could see good sitting in the window for well over 20 mins. No one there actually knows what they are doing.  Go for coffee and drinks not food!!"
4,Just had an amazing breakfast and received great customer service. Everything was great!! We will come back :)
2,"Average food, but expected. Service slow and inconsistent. Air temp in restaurant about 60 degrees do bring a light jacket."
1,"The service is terrible, It took at least an hour for my table to get our food after ordering it. Not to mention it is cold inside, and uncomfortable. The food was average."
0,"Service was slow; we were in a hurry and had to wait way to long even just to order a drink. The restaurant was nearly empty, and there seemed to be more than enough staff to handle all the tables. Pleeeease please be faster! Not everyone has time to wait around while you take your sweet time!\n\nAND the computers were, of course, down so we had to wait even longer to pay. My God, why why WHYYYYYYYYY. -___-"
0,"I've only gone to this IHOP once. Want to know why? I will tell you. Because I've never had worse service in my entire 22 years of being on this earth. \n\nI went at around 12am. Which is late, but no excuse for bad service! I have gone to Denny's later and had more cheery people around me. \n\nAnyway, so my bro and I get this one young waiter. Can't remember his name which is a shame. So he takes our order and is super short with us. Fine. Our food comes an hour later (I timed it) with only 2 other people in the whole restaurant. Okay. Cool. So I get my order, and it's 3 types of wrong. The waiter gets mad...at me??? Okay. Awesome. So he brings me my English muffin I ordered to being with. Except...it's half. If an English muffin. Confused, I asked where the rest of it was. He confessed that he dropped the other half, then ASKED ME if I wanted another one. Like 'Well I guess I can make you another one.'  Seriously? Wow! Yeah I didn't order half of an English muffin nor am I paying for it! Then because of his mix up, he actually never comes back to our table. Not even to bring me my muffin or to refill are cups (which were not refilled during our stay). \n\nI'm usually not harsh on waiters, they have a hard job. But half of an English muffin?? Please. First and hopefully only time I will never tip a person."
0,"I have been to this location a lot in the last few years and each time I come I regret it. Service and food seems to get worse every time. First of all it seems to have gotten less appetizing all around. To begin with the service is horrible. Long waits and Wait staff seem disinterested in what you are ordering, and they seem to always smell of cigarettes. I hate to judge on people physical appearance but the waiters all seem to look like those you would see in those faces of meth ads. Dirty, missing teeth, stained uniforms. I'm sorry but I prefer people to be clean and clean looking if they are serving and handling my food. The food here also has gone down hill. Nothing seems to taste quite right compared to other ihops in the area. They really need to do an over haul on this location. You'd expect better in Ahwatukee. You're better off at Denny's down the road ."
0,"My guy and I stood at the door waiting to be even acknowledged to be seated for about 7 minutes. No it was not busy, and no there was not a line. the MANAGER/SUP made eye contact with me and looked away not bothering to even direct a hostess or waitress over to seat us.\n\nOnce seated (eventually) the waiter came back to give us menus and take our drink orders and then take orders when he returned with our drinks. \n\nAt this point another party (of 5) were seated and helped by another wait person right behind us. \n\nThe people behind us had thier orders taken 10 minutes after us and were almost finished eating when we finally got our food, at this point its about 40 minutes after being seated and a half an hour after our food was ordered, and no, we weren't apologized to or checked on at all. \n\nAt some point another waitress (many of which seemed to be standing around) motioned to us and spoke to our waiter in spanish and he scoffed, literally out loud, like he didn't care that we were waiting.\n\nAfter we finished eating he offered to refill my drink (that had been empty for about half an hour at that point) I told him it was a little late for that. He only stopped by to clear dishes and drop the bill. He never checked on us to see how our meal was or if everything was ok.\n\nWe eat out often enough, we are good tippers, but no, We meant to leave you no tip, not because were cheap, because were aren't. It was meant as a slap in the face, because although I get that you were working on New Years Eve, we would have actually tipped you MORE for good service and having to work a holiday. We get that but we deserve to be treated properly. \n\nWe won't be returning to this location."
1,"Eh\nInteresting menu, but I found the food to be rather mediocre\nEven compared to the Rock Bottom at Desert Ridge\n\nI do enjoy their happy hour beer though, so 2 stars for a good microbrew!"
0,"Hubby has a thing for French Dips, so when the flier came in the mail advertising Rock Bottom's new Firehouse Specials, he really wanted to go, especially since we were in the area anyway. \n\nThe French Dip was on a \""pretzel roll\"" and my bite had soooooo much horseradish on it, I couldn't swallow it, and the bun was almost immediately mush. He also did not care for the beer \""jus\"" it came with. His sweet potato hash side looked overdone and simply not appetizing. He also had an Irish stout that he really liked.  I ordered a tasty portabello and spinach sandwich on a nice wheat roll with rosemary mayo. The fries that came with it were light and yummy. I thought I had by far the better of the two meals- until I spent a good part of the rest of the night on the potty. 'Nuff said. This is a family show."
3,"I've never had a bad meal at any of the locations/states I've eaten at.\n\nI don't drink beer but I enjoy the food. \nI most always order the same thing \""Mac and Cheese\"" no chicken, it comes with a decent house salad for only $7.99 (see pics) \n\nYou can't go wrong with this and two people could easily share this meal, it's alot!\n\nThey have some pretty good sandwiches like the \""Brewers Club\"" (see pics)\n\nI've also had their Chicken Fried chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes.\n\nDecent Food and relaxed environment make this place easy to enjoy.\n3.5 stars"
1,"Rock Bottom continues to earn it's name. I have been to this location on 5 separate occasions because my partner likes the beer varieties and the Pretzels. He has stopped telling me we are headed here because I will get them to change their mind before we arrive. After this last visit I told them that there are no more redeeming factors for me at this restaurant and I am not returning.\n\nChicken Oscar ~ belongs right in the trash with its muppet fur of shredded canned crab meat stuffed inside. Special of the night? It was a disaster and took forever to prepare. When I got it the chicken was dry and burnt all on the bottom. I could easily split the chicken open and see that the stuffing was a light smear of obvious canned shredded clam. The asparagus was hard and over buttered and the mashed potatoes were heavy and uninspired. It took so long and I couldn't get the waitstaff attention to bother returning it or thinking of more food to try. \nMy partner had a burger, it was nothing special. The good part of that meal were the kettle chips, really! They were awesome.\nWe enjoyed our pretzels very much.\nWe didn't stay for dessert, we've had problems with three of their desserts in the past and we weren't going to try them again.\nService and wait staff were slow and uninterested, it's July and it must suck to work there with it mostly empty, I know servers make crap, so I left a fair tip, but I'm done. \n\nIn this economic climate, either get good at what you do or go away. There are better places to eat. Tons of them."
2,"So Weekends are usually hubbys choice and he decided on Rock Bottom.\n\nI don't mind coming here, I really like their Mac and Cheese.\nYou can get it with or without chicken.........years ago the chicken was this really thin shaved peppered chicken and I thought it was awful so I have since always ordered without chicken.\n\nHowever today Hubby chose the mac and chicken and I was surprised that now they use real chunks of shredded chicken breast!! YAY! \nWhat and improvement!! It was really good! (see pics)\n. \n\nI got  the Turkey Bacon Cobb sandwich minus bacon =Layers of juicy oven-roasted turkey breast on grilled sourdough bread with sweet peppered bacon, sliced avocado, roasted tomatoes, sprouts and mixed greens. Topped with rosemary dressing and Bleu cheese crumbles (see pics)\n\nIt was better  than I expected, they forgot to put avocado on it though and\nthe bread was really really good and for being grilled it wasnt over saturated with grease.\n\nThe onion rings could have been crispier but were OK.\n\nLame waitress today she was new but whatever...she sucked!!"
1,This place is very average.  Very nice decor and the menu is pretty good but the atmosphere is crapola. especially for a brewery.  Trying to be upscale but it really doesnt get there.  Not bad for lunch specials but overall this place is just average.
0,"Last night, 1/17/09, my husband and I attended a birthday party for one of our friends at the Phoenix Rock Bottom location. While there, our service was terrible. We had to wait 45 minutes for our food to be ordered and we had to ask 3 times for a glass of water. The waitress took almost a half hour to bring our check to us after we asked for it. \n\nBy the next morning, I looked at my bank account to find that they had charged us for our meal twice and the second charge was for 4 times the cost of the actual meal. After calling to speak to the manager today, I was told that the money was not taken out of our account yet. He acted as if this there was really no reason to be concerned. He then told me that he would call me back later. After 4 hours, I had not heard from him, so I called again to be told that he would call me when he was not busy.\n\nI understand that mistakes happen, but I expect that they be remedied immediately and with a gracious attitude. At this point, my husband and I will not be returning to your company and we will be sure to let our friends know about this if the mistake is not at least reimbursed to us within 24 hours."
1,"Rock Bottom Brewery is a chain of microbrew restaurants, and the Ahwahtukee location is one of the worst ones I've been two (been to three). \n\nThe best thing about this establishment is the $3 draft/$3 appetizer happy hours, but that is sadly eclipsed by the poor service, ambiance and quality of food. The beer - overall - is fair. There were no clear cut winners. The stout was not so good: I ended up returning it for the nut brown ale, which fared slightly better. The pale ale was better.\n\nThe service was negligent and awful. She was inattentive, and ended up serving me a beef burger after a conversation with her about getting a veggie burger. Funny thing is, the place wasn't packed last night either. I'm not looking for four-star service, but complete lack of attention stands out for me. Also, the family-style setting (tons of suburban families) really didn't do it for me, so I'll probably only come back if asked to by a friend, not on my own will."
1,"The food's good, the beer's usually good, the brewmaster's awesome. If I could rate a restaurant just on those criteria, it would easily be a 4-star joint.\n\nBut this Rock Bottom location has a chronic, nagging problem: The service.\n\nSeveral years ago they were great--waitstaff was on their game, management was always around to check on things and even work the floor. Since that time, the awesome management has been promoted up into corporate and the service really hasn't been the same. A 30 minute lunch turns into an hour, drinks remain empty, the bill sits on the table while you try in vain to get your waiter to pick it up. \n\nOccasionally Rock Bottom teases me with a great service, but then it just lets me down with another trip to slowsville on the next visit. Good eats if you've got the time, but don't go expecting a quick meal."
2,"They lose 1 star for not having any hard cider in stock...supposedly they ran out. I can't drink beer so I was left to drink a very fruity cosmo. \n\nOverall, this place isn't anything special. I hear the beer is good though. One thing going for them is that they have a great happy hour. $3 drinks and munchies M-F from 3:30 - 6:30. \n\nThe atmosphere is nothing special. Bathrooms were clean though and there is plenty of seating."
2,"This is a place where I want to try many things on the menu. The descriptions sound really good and, so far, the meals have been pretty good.\n\nThis place isn't bad for food. The beer is alright, but I've had better. The worst part about this place is the service. My husband and I have had the same waiter twice now, and both times he has mumbled his way through service, showed no enthusiasm and didn't pay much attention. But when it was time to leave, he sure did rush us our check.\n\nI would certainly recommend it for the food, but otherwise you might be better off elsewhere."
0,"This Rock Bottom is awful. A poor example of an already poor chain.\n\nWhat's comical is that we came here with gift certificates we got from the manager of the Desert Ridge location after our food came out cold after a 45-minute wait. We figured maybe another location would be better.\n\nDead wrong. I don't know if the food was an improvement because we went on a Saturday afternoon and waited a full 5 minutes inside before being acknowledged and seated. The place was deserted and we sat at our table for another 10 minutes before being approached by a waiter reeking of cigarette smoke. I guess this restaurant is being run by 1 or 2 people? I wouldn't be surprised if the hostess was back in the kitchen ready to cook our order.\n\nWe didn't wait around to find out. I eventually took my gift certificates to the Scottsdale location and blew them all on beer and filet mignon before they expired, but that's a different review."
2,"I go to rock bottom for happy hour frequently. I never go for lunch or dinner. The happy hour beer is a great deal, at 18oz. for $3. The beer, itself, ranges quite a bit, but it's generally on par with standard US microbrews, with some significantly better. The food is nothing special. The service also varies a lot, so I'm not surprised to find some people got some bad service.\n\nFor people who liked the brewmaster, Guy is no longer with the company. A new brewmaster, Rob, took over, this spring. He was at this location a few years ago, then went to Scottsdale, and is now back. Personally, I like his brews better than Guy's, but others could disagree. I've been told Rob's specialty is brown ale, and I can see why.\n\nOverall, for some decent, local beer, after work, it's a great spot. For anything else, I'd go someplace else."
1,"About the same as the other locations for Rock Bottom in the Phoenix area, but this one is more convenient to a major highway (I-10).  I wish they would stop making so many menu changes, which are often for the worse.  Food has gone downhill in the last couple years, and beers are rather uninspiring.  For convenience sake I might stop here with low expectations, but if you have the time I'd advise that you seek another dining choice."
2,"Last night I stopped by Rock Bottom with some friends for a late dinner & drinks. I ordered the fish & chips. I love fish & chips and this was the first time I had seen Salmon instead of white fish. The menu described it as Ale-battered, alder-smoked salmon served with fries, Brewery slaw, malt vinegar and homemade remoulade sauce... All I know is that it was yummy.\n\nI also had the DreamWeaver Wheat Ale. Both selections were very good - the fish had a great taste - nicely crisp on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Good fries and a satisfying beer. My friends split some type of steak dish with vegetables. Both commented on how good it was. \n\nFinish off with a small dessert - they had this little mini chocolate peanut butter cookie thing for $2.50. Small, but good.\n\nThe dining area was spacious - I have bad seating karma. I am a big dude and for some reason they love to sit me in the smallest places. Three of us were put at a bar table in the bar, when there were open booths near by. At least I got to see the football game. What surprised me was that on a Friday night, it wasn't very busy. Soon after we arrived, other booths cleared out, the bar was down to two gus at opposite ends - not what I would expect for a brewery on Friday night. Maybe they should have more happy hour specials and get people to come out?\n\nGood food, good beer and the server was excellent. The atmosphere a little dead."
2,"a bar chain is a bar chain is a bar chain.  Nothing really special here but nothing incredibly bad either.  burgers, beers, drunk people puking in the restroom, good drunk times for everyone.  This one seems to have a longer wait than the others in the chain ive been to and the client\u00e8le  rowdy but if the company is right you can have an fun time here."
3,"This is \""my place\""- if you come to town, we eat here. If you want to grab a drink, we'll go here! We even spent one horribly drunken New Year's Eve partying it up with the Rock Bottom crew. This would normally be a 5-star review but I feel like their service has gone downhill a bit in the last 6 months and this could stand to be addressed.\n\nFirst of all, you cannot beat Happy Hour! As a beer snob, I often feel left out when the Happy Hour specials only include America's favorite urine-colored watered down drinks. Occasionally I can get a Sam Adam's or Blue Moon, but it's nothing to match. The specials here vary by the day but you'll be able to get a pint of beer or a mixed drink for around $3- sign up for their free Mug Club and you'll get 20oz mugs every time too! There's a patio with smoking on one side only- it's great to sit out there most of the year but does get packed close to the weekends. \n\nThe food specials at Happy Hour beat the oh-so-cheap yet mediocre Applebee's standard. Most appetizers are $3- a few items, such as sliders, show up just for happy hour and aren't even on the regular menu. There is a burger they offer for $5, and you can get a bucket of fries or kettle chips for $1.50. The sliders are my favorite (both chicken and beef), and i'd also recommend kettle chips, the spinach artichoke dip, or the nachos. \n\nThe beers could almost use their own review- there are 6 or 7 to try and account for what people like to drink. There is usually a special seasonal beer along with a cask-conditioned option. As I mentioned before, the best way to drink beer is with a Mug Club card. You'll get a 20oz mug for the 16oz price and accumulate points towards things such as logo pint glasses. If you like the urine-variety of mass-produced beers, try a Dreamcatcher. If you enjoy good flavor, try the El Jefe Hefeweizen, Desert Trail Pale Ale, or Raptor Red. At this location in particular I think the El Jefe is the best. \n\nThe food is delicious- i'm getting to the point where i've tried almost everything on the menu. The standouts are the Mac N' Chicken, the Lemon Chicken, the Smoked Salmon Fish and Chips, and the Prime Rib (they run specials on this at various times of the year). A lot of entrees come with the wonderful White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the vegetables you are served are pretty flavorful. Definitely good enough to deserve coming here even if you don't drink beer.\n\nMy only complaints lately are that the service has gone downhill. We've been several times in the past few months- 3 times for happy hour and once for dinner. One time at happy hour was perfect, the second our food came out and had clearly been sitting around (coagulated cheese skin on top of the artichoke dip), and the third the food had only sat a tiny bit but it took us forever to get the attention of our waitress. The time we went for dinner the food was good, but it took a long time and didn't come out all at once. If the restaurant can resolve this, it'll earn its 5th star."
0,"Horrible service.  Waited over 1 hour to be seated, then another 30 minutes without a waiter before leaving.  Other customers complained about food quality.  AVOID.  Go to the Yardhouse in the Mall."
2,"Pork mexican dish with rice and beans was very tasty!  Laredo burger was tasty, but under my expectations for a restaurants burger.  Pub coleslaw was different and tasty.  I enjoy Erik the Red beer.  OVerall, this place is pricy.  The beer is more pricy than any other place I went in Zona.  It's a good place to try, but I feel like I'm in a more expensive Chilis when I should be at a more exciting microbrewery."
2,"When we walked in, Modern English's 'Melt with you' was playing rather loudly over the house sound system.  Everyone in there looked older than both my wife and I.  The hostess asked if we wanted to be seated for dinner or if we wanted to have happy hour in the bar area.  We chose the bar.\n\nMy wife had whatever their brown ale is, I think it's Roadrunner Brown or something along those lines.  I had iced tea.  We noticed our bar table was not clean but we let it slide as it wasn't horribly dirty.  \n\nThe waitress came and went.  When my iced tea was empty, I'd look for her and she would magically appear with a pitcher of iced tea.  Although fairly happy and somewhat charming (for a waitress in a place like this), she didn't really go above and beyond in her service but she wasn't terrible either.  \n\nHappy hour: three dollar pints of their micro-brewed beer and three dollar appetizers.  We had wings and nachos which were good enough.  I really liked the nachos.  Mind you, happy hour portions aren't as large as regular portions but also they're only $3 bucks.  \n\nWhen we were leaving Lady Gaga's \""Alejandro\"" was blasting over the house sound system.  It made me think that this is the place where older people go to feel like they're still 'in tuned' with what the younger folks are up to.  I started to feel middle aged."
1,"This place is wretched, and the service always sucks! We were one of only 3 tables in the place at 3:30pm and still had trouble getting served. The manager, or what looked like the manager (a person carrying keys, doing voids, and walking behind the bar) not once made eye contact with us. The server had to ask \""just so I get this straight...you ordered the salad with ranch\"" We ordered the Ahi app, chips and guacamole, and the full-rack of ribs. The food was tasty, but once again the service sucks. Our server tried to give our tab to the ladies behind us, then complained out loud that the other server screwed things up, all the while we were waiting for the tab. He then had to explain that I really would not be getting charged twice, it would only be on my credit card for a few days. No one ever said thanks for coming in, and we were left to walk out...never to return."
0,I would give this place a 0 star if I could. The short rib is salty and overcooked. We ordered the sample size ahi tuna and they charged us full prize. The prime rib was tough and half was fat. I will never come back.  This place Is scam. The waiter Eddie accused us of receiving the larger size ahi.  Unbelievable service
2,"It was ok...good crowd for at Tuesday so all of those that complain about no crowd must go at really odd times.\n\nBlack and tan was black - they could not separate the two..disappointing.\n\nFood was ok, not outstanding.\n\nThe burger was rated as very good; Jambalaya....fair at best...two friggin shrimp could they spare it?\n\nService was ok...I might go back but if it's not any better, then adios.\n\nOh yeah, when you unroll your utensils the last thing you want to see is someone else's dinner stuck to your knife - (gagging sounds kick in here)."
0,"My husband and I got horrible food poisoning from this restaurant. -- so bad in fact , that it warranted medical attention.We contacted their corporate office and were completely blown off by their insurance company.\nThis establishment has no regard for the well being of its patrons. Since we value our health we will never go back"
2,"Food was ok but the beer was very good.  The service was rather poor and considering how empty the place was I would have expected a much more attentive waitress. I like the building and the open space is nice, too bad it's way down in Ahwatukee."
3,"For far to long I put this place at the rock bottom of my brewery list in town, it seems that I was mistaken.\n\nMany years had passed since my last visit here, and after an invite from some friends and a good tasting at the last yelp event I went in.\n\nWe sat on the large patio to enjoy the great spring AZ weather, it also enable us to accommodated upwards for 20 people at our conjoined table.\n\nHappy hour was in full effect $3.25 beers (in a mug) and $5 pizza's and appetizers.\n\nI started off with a stout, it was nice full bodied not to bitter and with a rich head. I learned that each beer is made on site with their own local recipes\n\nFor food I went with the margarita pizza ($5 on HH $10 normal).  TO my surprised it was cooked in a open flame oven and it was almost a Bianco style pizza, it had fresh motzrella , basil, tomatoes and pesto on it. It was pretty good but a bit low on the crust to topping ratio. \n\nService was decent for a large patio party too.\n\nHappy hr is  3:30pm - 6:30pm & 9-Close all days, give it a try"
1,"OK i had to write a review because I was very disappointed!\n\nI gave this place the benfit of the doubt only because i heard they had a great happy hour and it is a brewery! Plus they only had 3 stars when i looked over the yelp reviews, I wanted to help improve that......Big mistake .....I should've listened to my fellow yelpers. I decided to have my birthday dinner here on a friday, we decided we would meet early for happy hour then move to dining area for dinner. Well my small party of 4 got there around 6:15pm, we thought it was just in time to put in a quick order for cheap food and drinks, but it took forever to find an available server, one guy stopped by and said he'll be \""back in a sec\"" but never did. So we decided to move to the patio where we thought it would be easier to put in our order, the lady taking orders was nice enough to put our order in 2 minutes before it ended. We were rushed and didnt even have the HR menus to look over because they guy never gave us them and there weren't any on the patio table. She was also pretty slow at getting them, i'm sure we would've had 4 minutes to order if she knew the urgency of HR ending at 6:30pm!!  Come on now.....There were alot of older people and it got pretty dead after HR ended..\n\nAfter that we moved to the dining area where other members of our party met us. The menu looked good from the pictures and description they gave....but the beer selection was very limited. :( White ale, red ale, dark ale??? ok.. at least put some personality into naming them and make sure your server is educated on each beer.\n\nOver all the food sucked and beer sucked. No taste in either one.. It was a sad birthday dinner, yes i ate all my food because i was starving! I didnt get sick so that's good.... We had one beer/drink each and regreted the beer choice after the first sip, we left right away to get a real drink. Oh I did have a choice of either a free cake or drink for my Bday, I chose the carrot cake.. it was good, not the best. She just sat it down on the table said happy birthday then walked off......uh thanks yay happy birthday to me... oh and she charged us for the cake.. but corrected it after we mentioned it.\n\n I know better now to stick with the good ol' Four Peaks Brewery for GREAT Food and Beer!  They have an extensive selection of beer to choose from, even if it isn't made in their brewery!\n\nServers/ hostess were nice, except for mr. invisable... \n\nJust dont go....maybe for HR but you wont taste much:(\n\n*Excuse my spelling and sentences, just so much happened and I can't think right trying to get it all out!"
2,"Rock Bottom seems to be hit, or miss. They have a pretty decent menu with a variety of items. Their happy hours is sort of ho-hum for me. There's not really a lot of good deals to be had, but beers are relatively well priced even when not on happy hour.\n\nI had gotten two vouchers from restaurant.com and used those on two separate occasions. The first time I got the prime rib, and though I was excited to order it, I wasn't excited to finish it. It tasted as thought it had been cooked too long and there was very little flavor or moisture remaining in the meat.\n\nHowever, still having another coupon I returned a second time. The second experience I ordered a steak. My wife ordered on also. I ordered mine the house default which is a little bit between medium and medium rare and it was delicious. Well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. My wife ordered hers more well done and it came out very well done. The flavor was not great, even for her. I realize that it goes without saying that it is usually best to order what the kitchen is good at doing, but be cautious in ordering things well done or you might get it really well done. We had chips which are rather cheap and they come with a sufficient serving size and decent salsa. If you like hefeweizens they have a great wit-bier that tastes similar to blue-moon with a greater serving of cloves. It tastes good and I was a fan."
4,"I LOVE Rock bottom. My husband and I live down the street and go here frequently. I always get a burger (99% of the time), and my husband alternates with whatever sounds good. \nWe like it so much we often order for pickup on long days! \nThey have great, accommodating managers, very kind, attentive staff, and a fun atmosphere!"
1,"Used to be great.  Took the good stuff off the menu.... No asiago and beer bread, fish and chips changed to cod vs. Salmon.  Oh well, just will quit going."
0,"We have ate here a few times, this visit was one of the worst experiences we have had in a long time.  The host who sat us (2+our baby) was very rude, acted like we were inconviencing him by coming in. (Took about 5 minutes before he even came to sit us).  He also clearly saw our baby however didn't offer a booster or a high chair.   He did however give us a kids coloring menu (but they don't have crayons??? Really?)  The waitress was also in some type of mood and for some reason decided to take a job at a brewery knowing nothing about beer.  I asked what wheat beers they had, she suggested a house beer---umm, not a wheat at all....food took about 30-40min after ordering to come...awesome with a restless baby and no crayons...  terrible experience (crappy employees, took to long, burger was really dry, waitress dosent know anout beers at a brewery, no crayons for their kids coloring menus)... ohh I also forgot to add the floors in the restaurant was disgusting, looked like it hadent been swept or moped in quite some time.....bathroom was much worse....   what a waste of a trip"
0,What happened to this place? We have been here quite a few times and this last visit will probably be the last. We had bad service from the get go. No one sat us right away the servers were walking by looking at us but no host came. I had trouble finding anything on the menu that on a hot day in phoenix sounded good. Everything is pricey too for being so-so food. Salads are $10 and up. A trip to the bathroom grossed me out with greasy smudged hand prints all over the black stall doors. Walking back I noticed the floors were covered in crumbs and food. Our little boy dropped something under our table and let's just say they can keep it because it was filthy under there. \nNo more rock bottom for us!

4,"i'm starving, so i'm going to write a review for the place i'd like to go to lunch to today.\n\nthey have the most delicious bagel sandwiches anywhere! i think it has something to do with my new obsession with mustard - here you have three choices, which they apply liberally .\n\nThere never seems to be anyone in line (except in the morning hours) so i can order and sit down or be back at the office in no time. they have booths, tables and outside patio tables.\n\n $7 for sandwich, chips and a drink, and it kicks subway or sub factory's ass. \n\ndamn i'm hungry."
3,"I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there.\n\nThoughts: Staff was friendly and quick, nice place, very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well.\n\nChicken salad bagel sandwich wasn't too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - I'd probably eat it again however.  Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum!  I'm wanting to go back to try different menu items now :)"
1,"My standards are pretty low while extremely hung over wearing the same clothes I participated in crazy drunken debauchery the night before. But I still left Bagel Nosh feeling like I wished I had gone to IHOP next door.\n\nI ordered the $7 Arizona Classic: an egg sandwich with bacon and cheese on the bagel of my choice. The quality was pretty much on par with a McBagel McSandwich but was twice the price. The bacon was more like bacon bits and the egg was thin and tasteless. There was nothing wrong with the service, but the prices were way too high for what I was eating.\n\nMy friends had ordered a bagel with spread that looked better. So I guess the rule of thumb here would be to order a bagel only. I would definitely leave other breakfast food concoctions to another restaurant."
1,I am surprised by the good reviews.  I went as a last minute lunch and got a veggie bagel sandwich with fruit and a pickle spear.  It was about $5.50 with tax and I left still hungry.  The bagel was just okay.  The fruit was very fresh and that was a plus.\n\nI have had much better bagel sandwiches.  I miss Brueggers in Chandler.
2,"Came in Sunday am and this place was hopping.  They seem to have a lot of regulars.  The hubby and I both had bagel sandwhiches and they were very tasty.  Much better than those at Einstein's... I am pretty sure that place uses powdered eggs.  However, I think I do like the bagels better at Einstein's and they have more flavored cream cheese.  I will probably come to Bagel Nosh again b/c I prefer to support the locally owned businesses over chains but I am not really sure if this place deserves the 4 1/2 stars it currently has.\n\nMaybe part of that is due to my bad experience there.  I ordered a latte with my bagel sandwhich and it took a long time to come out, even after the food.  Then when I finally got it instead of coffee they had given me hot chocolate.  A simple mistake but it can be really jarring when your mouth is expecting one thing and you get another.  Plus I really don't like sugar in the morning and this was extremely sugary sweet.  They did replace it with the latte I ordered but it made me a little grumpy to have to wait so long for my coffee on a Sunday morning so it kind of ruined my day.\n\nI will definitely give them another try and may raise the stars higher in the future.  But I think there are better bagel places in the area.  I LOVE Back East Bagels on Southern and I deeply miss Bruegger's that used to be on Rural and Chandler Blvd - they were the best!"
3,"For a bagel shop in the desert, it doesn't get much better.  Great selection of fresh bagels (I love the Salt w/ lox).  \n\nThe service is quick and friendly, and the decor has local flavor you wont find at any big chain.  The owners really turned this place around about 4 years ago.  Now it is a thriving local hangout for the active adult in Ahwatukee.  In fact, they attract so many road bikers, a bike shop opened next door last year."
4,"Rob & Darcy have done an amazing job on the remodel and transforming the cafe into more than just bagels and cream cheese. They have really good coffee as well! The staff, for the most part, is friendly and helpful. \n\nFree wi-fi is a plus! :)"
2,"Hello to all you foodies out there!\n\nBeen looking for a good Bagel place in the area, because as we all know, bagels are an essential part of life.\n\nWe know what the chain bagel places are all about....ok bagels and lousy cream cheese...so I am happy to say Bagel Nosh has some superior cream cheese.\n\nSince this review is about finding a good bagel place, I guess we should start with the bagels.\n\nThere is a nice variety of bagels but alas....no egg bagel.  boooooooo\n\nTo me, the bagels are similar to the kind you buy in a grocery store bakery area...they are not dense(as I grew up with in Chicago or even New York) but almost fluffier, but they are still good.\n\nSo much for the bagels...let get to the cream cheese!  \n\nThe cream cheese is creamy and thick but not too thick and very flavorful.\n\nWhen enjoying their bagel and cream cheese sandwich it is safe to say it is the cream cheese that you notice.\n\nI will continue to search for the type bagel I enjoy and in the meantime I will continue to enjoy Bagel Nosh.\n\nI would also like to mention the service is great and the employees are wonderful and very friendly and that alone will bring me back!\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\nI think you should check this place out and in the meantime....\n\nBon Appetite'"
4,Great place for a simple bagel and cream cheese or yummy lunch sandwich! Great food!
4,"Their bagels are great, but the place is packed on weekend mornings. Service is still quick even when it is busy though."
3,"YUM.  I popped in here for a quick breakfast sandwich, and it was incredibly good & affordable.  Hoping to return to try some of the other food items, but that toasted cheese bagel with ham, cheese, and egg was delicious."
3,"The Nosh is as good as it gets. Although it closes at 2pm daily and the bad customer service, the bagel sandwiches are extremely good! Nosh, is also one of the few joints that still carries spouts. Which i love!"
3,Best bagel that I have had so far in Phoenix. I had a simple egg and cheese on An everything bagel and it met my expectations. I went on a Sunday morning and it was chaotic and narrow and hard to get around. That is my only criticism.
4,"Everything about this place is great. The coffee is spectacular. The food is healthy and fresh. Customer service is great. Friendly staff that will always go the extra mile to satisfy guests. (The place gets pretty busy, so don't go in expecting speedy service during breakfast/lunch rush)."
1,"This place is ok. I've only ever tried breakfast bagel sandwiches. The bagels are good. Eggs have no flavor, not even salt and pepper. Customer service could be way better. Outdoor seating is a bonus."
3,The breakfast burrito never disappoints and the kids love the pancakes. Nice selection of coffee and bagels keeps everyone in the family satisfied. A little pricey but the food quality is good. For Ahwatukee it's probably 5 stars but sine there are better places around Phoenix its a 4. They should expand into a bigger space as this places gets crowded in a hurry.
3,"I can completely thank Yelp App for this great find, I was way too early to head into work and wanted some breakfast and not from a fast food chain, so I looked what was in the area and found the Nosh Cafe so off I went.\n\nWhen I got there it had a little line, but don't worry, it moves sort of fast, while waiting in line I checked out the menu board and saw they had a lot going on, that I want to try it all, but I had to limit my choice to just one this time around.\n\nNow they have breakfasts off the grill and breakfast sandwiches, so I knew the sandwiched sounded good, so I checked out the selection and went with the Ranchero on a jalapeno bagel and a large caramel latte. The Ranchero was egg, sausage, red onion & house made southwest cream cheese; it was a great breakfast bagel sandwich.\n\nHappy to had found Nosh Cafe, and saw they do lunch and its less than 2 miles from my work, so I can pretty much say I will be back again soon."
3,"My first visit to Nosh was great! No waiting an hour for a table and the food was really good. A win-win on a Sunday morning. I ordered a bagel sandwich and a side of hashbrowns. The bagel was 1. Huge 2. Soft and chewy 3. Completely satisfying. The eggs were fluffy and the sausage was flavorful too making for an excellent bagel sandwich. The hashbrowns were also yummy. They were buttery without being greasy, salty and had just the right amount of crispiness. I tried a bite of my friend's pancake and that was good too - very fluffy.\n\nThe service was friendly and fast, too. The only downside was that it was a little loud inside. They did have a few tables outside but they were full. Next time if it's not too hot I would probably go outside for a little quiet. But either way, I'll be back!"
3,"Great bagels, friendly people, quick service, nice modern decor and spectacular drawing on the menu (in the wall).\nThey sweat the little details like the sauce and condiments section all nearly stacked.\nThe girls that work there are all young so they might not be the most refined taking the dishes and trays out of your way but they do smile all the time!"
3,Went here for the first time and had breakfast. The hashbrowns and pancakes were awesome. Can't wait to go back for lunch sometime.
4,My favorite place in Ahwatukee! They have the best bagels and homemade cream cheese & freshly squeezed OJ to boot. The other breakfast items are all top notch as well. Friends always tell me the coffee is choice too! Lunch is good but the breakfast is where its at.
1,"The Nosh is ok.  Bagels are mediocre, nothing special.  The older lady who works behind the counter should stay at home.  She's short worded, unwelcoming, and flat out rude to customers.  If you want a real bagel with friendly service there is a much better place up the street on Elliot.  However, if you want an Einstein's copy with Darth Vader behind the counter, come to The Nosh."
4,"I just happened upon this place on our way to ikea and we're pleasantly surprised! We came for lunch right before it closed so there weren't many people the workers were extremely friendly and they seem to get along well. Since they were about to close they did not have the bagel I originally wanted but I tried the blueberry with plain cream cheese, most bagels taste the same but I think that the flavor was much better than most. We also had the tombstone wrap with a spinach wrap, it was a little spicy but not overpowering. There was a lot of bacon, which isn't my favorite, but if you like bacon then this sandwich is for you! I will definitely be eating here again."
4,"Just tried this place yesterday & I am in love. I ordered a cheese bagel with sweet habanero spread. It was the yummiest thing ever!! I sadly didn't get to try it until I got to work and by then it was cold but still delicious. It was so good I went back this morning and ordered it again! This time I ate it on my way to work. So yummy when it's warm and toasty! I will probably be back tomorrow and will try to make myself try something new. There are a lot of options! \n\nWhile I am in love with the bagel, the coffee was just meh. One review on here mentions that the mocha is better than Starbucks. I would have to disagree. Tried the latte today and was also not impressed. I like my coffee to be more on the sweet side though.\n\nAlso the older woman who is mentioned in another review is just as you described: short with words and grumpy. It's kind of a turn off but when the bagel is that good I will put up with it! \n\nI don't like the debit card machine and the place to tip. I feel obligated to tip every time because they just look at you waiting for your response. I don't mind tipping but if I'm just getting a to go order is it really necessary?"
0,Very disappointing! There are much better places to go for bagels and breakfast stuff.The service is lacking both in efficiency and friendliness. Actually the girl behind the counter was rude and discourteous.\nThe food was just ok nothing special\nThe best thing about eating there is I don't ever have to eat there again\nCan't imagine they'll be in business for long\nYuk :(
4,"The Nosh is the spot .. Great people , Great service and great food . I've been coming here for over  3 yrs and  every time the experience is AWESOME . Everything is wonderful . Bagels , Salads , Soups etc . If you get a chance please try the Southwest Corn Chowder . Awesome !!!!!"
3,"Small hole in the wall ... Amazing brunch place in the neighborhood.. I have tried almost all their pancakes... Fresh and yummy food... Be ready to wait in line over the weekends as it can get packed,.. \nBut totally worth it... I recommend all their bagels and omelettes as well ...good service and great place for a family breakfast ...inside and outside seating available with ample parking :)"
4,5 Stars for what it is...Dairy Queen! Who doesn't like a Blizzard? Fast and Yummy. In and out with a Blizzard Meal Deal. I was spoon fed a Hawaiian Blizzard on the drive home...it doesn't get much better than that.
3,"Of all the Dairy Queens I've been to in my life in CA, TX and now AZ, this is the nicest and cleanest location I've been to. I guess that's what happens in Awhatukee.\n\nThe staff is fast when you order inside and also when you order through the drive thru.\n\nI could eat Chicken Finger Baskets and Blizzards all the time! I'm happy to live so close to this location and enjoy all the wonderful treats this place has to offer."
1,I was craving Dairy Queen for quite awhile.  When I finally went I was wondering what I wanted it so badly for?  I ordered a grape freeze.  The icey slush mixed with soft serve vanilla.  It was was so mediocre.  I felt like I was wasting calories for the day.  If I want a treat I can think of such better/higher quality treats and ice cream.
0,"My girlfriend recently took her 2009 Nissan Altima to this Big O for an oil change and tire rotation. Sep 14, 2012,  They recommended an air filter change and she agreed, got the car back and the next morning it stalls while driving to work. The car restarted and everything seemed fine. Called the owner' Ray\"" and he said bring it in and we'll take a look to make sure it's not anything we did. After keeping the car for the entire day Sep 15th, they said it was a bad \""O2\"" sensor and it would cost $300 to replace. They said they connected a diagnostic device to the car to get the problem code. Luckily, I have a friend that owns an automotive business in the west valley and we took the car to him for a 2nd opinion. His techs did another diagnostic evaluation and there was nothing wrong with the O2 sensor, or any other part of the car. They specifically stated that they also checked the history of the computerized fault notification and there has never been a problem with any sensor of the car. \nPlease be very aware of the practices of this establishment as they are and will erroneously recommend unnecessary work on cars of unsuspecting customers. I am not sure if the fact that a female came by herself to get her car serviced presented an opportunity for this type of false diagnosis, but we are very happy to have known better than to trust the smiling faces and what appeared to be great customer service."
0,"I have been going to Big O Tires for the past five years, and I have brought in one or two friends and always recommended the store on 4832 EAST WARNER ROAD, #4203, PHOENIX, AZ 85044.  After my experience with this store on 9/4/12 and 9/28/12 that is no longer the case.  The service at this store is deplorable, and here's why.\n\nOn 9/4/12 I brought in my 1998 Chevy Malibu for several things, one of them being the windows, which do not move up or down.  When I brought the car in, in the morning the driver's side window was in the up position.  When I came back to pick it up later that afternoon it  was and still is remains, in the open position halfway.  Why was it so hard to put it back the way it was found?  \n\nOn 9/28/12 I brought the car back to double check the brakes that had been worked on previously on 9/4/12 and asked that they put the window back up.  I arrived around 1pm, I was told it would take a couple of hours, that was fine, I have no problem waiting an equitable amount of time.  At 2:38pm another customer came in with a big red truck with a lift kit on it.  He was also told a couple of hours, I was in the front when this happened standing by the window looking out at traffic, I was tired of sitting in the waiting room.  I heard the whole conversation.  I heard the guys in the front say they only had two techs working and cars ahead of him.  \n\nYou can imagine my surprise when at 3:45 while I'm sitting in the waiting room watching the t.v. back there, this same customer walks in and sits down, and not five minutes later a tech comes in and tells him he's all done.  I hadn't heard anything on my car at that point, I saw that it was up a lift, that was it.  You only have two techs working, there's going to be a two hour wait, and he's done! Really?!  Why couldn't the other tech help out on my car which had been there AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE his?  \n\nFrom a customer stand point I feel like Big O really doesn't care about its customers.  Big O for sure doesn't care about my time or energy.  A cooler, shinier, newer vehicle comes along and that one just has to be done first, that's just not right.  Big O has betrayed my trust, and Big O has betrayed my loyalty.\n\nAt this point I no longer consider myself a big o customer and will not be singing your praises any further.  I can and am multiplying my disdain for this utterly disrespectful behavior far past the \""11\"" people that a dissatisfied customer complains too."
4,These guys are awesome.  The store at this location was able to balance my tires quickly after another store tried three times only to tell me it was as good as it was going to get.  Thanks Ray.....
0,"Do not get your car serviced here. We purchased a groupon for 3 oil changes. We called to make an appointment and they said no need just walk in. We walked in and this guy said they're too busy to get us in. we argued and we got in. they told us the groupon will be in the system and we do not need to keep the printed groupon. The 2nd time we came back they asked for the groupon. We argued then the guy working the counter gives us a punch card and says, \""ok ill let it slide this time, but here is a punch card for the future.\"" We've been here 3 hours and our car is still \""30 minutes away\"" Judge Joe Brown is on the TV in the waiting room. I am. Going. Insane."
0,"Spent $500 on a radiator for my truck. After 53 weeks it failed completely, 12 months and a week. Warranty was 12 months or 12k miles, total BS as every one else has lifetime warranty. This Big O is big CRAP. Read the fine print! These losers are like a Jiffy Lube. YOU WILL GET SCREWED! By the way, this is a private owned franchisee and not subject to Big O policies!!!!! SCAMMER AND CHEAT!!!! SO, I GUESS IF YOU BUY A RADIATOR FROM BIG O; YOU'DE BETTER BE PREPARED TO BUY ONE EVERY YEAR!!!!!"
4,"Fantastic price, great Custer service, thank you Russell. So nice not to be upsaled constantly. Beat discount tire by $70 on a single tire. Bathrooms super clean too. Asked if they had any specials and automatically saved $10 on my oil change. Thanks!"
4,"Great Service! Reliable and friendly! They aloud me to keep my car on the lot for a day until they transfered the right tire to their location. They were swift to repairs and they aligned my tires, so now I have a smooth ride!"
3,"this place tastes like high school :) \ngone are the days of actually waking up early enough to get ready someplace other than in my car, but to actually want to make time to stop and get coffee. \n\neverytime I go to my parents I make a stop here.  i recommend everything. I always add soymilk- some employees don't charge for it and some do. I say flash them a few smiles, it will increase your chances for free soy. unless you're a guy- no soy for you. i heard it can create moobs and, well, i want to prevent you from developing moobs. \n\nI love their version of the caramel machiatto. it's the best i've ever had.\n\nSeattle Espresso is sorta like 'if you give a mouse a cookie' in that if you give me a latte then i'll want to stop in hobby lobby or target. and if i go to hobby lobby expect me to disappear for a long time and i will ask to borrow someones hot glue gun. you get the idea."
3,"Silky lattes, friendly service, and no corporate vibe.  Exactly what I look for in a coffee shop!  A friend turned me on to this little hole in the wall a few months ago, and every time we're in the area we swing in, me for a vanilla latte, she gets a mocha...it's hard to decide which is better, but I'm partial to my soy vanilla latte, so that always wins out...I do steal a few sips from her cup though...when she's not looking..."
4,Cool staff and vibe plus great coffee
4,"This isn't your corner Starbucks by far.  It's small company that caters to it's repeat customers.  I've been going to Seattle Espresso for over ten years now and it's by far one of my favorite places to grab a drink.  My favorite is their Bella Mocha.  SE uses a bitter sweet chocolate sauce made by a Seattle company called Dilettante Chocolates. They also use cream (sorry health nuts - not your drink) that gives it a bit of a silky buttery taste mixed in with the bittersweet chocolate.  I would class it a Bittersweet Nirvana!  Starbucks's new Cocoa Cappuccino does not even compare to it and all it does is make me crave the Bella Mocha even more.  Another plus with SE is that they use an Italian Roast Coffee bean for it's espresso drinks.  Strong and full of flavor, and again this may not be your cup of Starbucks.   So if you like Italian roasted espresso and full flavored concoctions, give it a try!"
1,"I have tried this place a few times, but I have to agree the  barristers always seem to be in a bad mood and put out when you order.  They never say hello or seem to even want you in the place.  There are always a couple people in there so maybe they just like their regulars.  I always get the same thing at every coffee place, a mocha, and the ones here don't ever taste like espresso or chocolate they always taste like milk.  If you are in the shopping center I guess it's passable, but I wouldn't go out of my may since there is a coffee place in every shopping center here."
1,"I decided to try this place instead of Starbucks for once. The large mochas cost about the same as Starbucks' venti, but they're about the size of Starbucks' grande. In other words, you get a lot less coffee for the money. The coffee also isn't nearly as good as Starbucks-- it just tasted watery and milky to me. Looks like I'm going back to Starbucks!"
2,"Honestly have experienced better. The management company (@UDR) is publicly traded so no surprise that interests are investors and not residents. Sierra Foothills, is not great at communication or transparency. Just a month ago notices were placed that they would be entering the dwellings for inspection - made me feel like a cell toss in Shawshank - come to later find out it was a prospective buyer of the property. My mailbox has been broken for 5 weeks; no notification about resolution or ETA. The USPS says it's up to the property to repair - UDR says it's up to the USPS. The front pool and fitness center is great and wonderful to spend time in and the clubhouse is 24 hour which is nice. All in all, the community is kept and it's where I call home, but let Sierra Foothills be a  \""come back to re-review\"" in your apartment searching. Service request resolution time is quick, but overall management practice and communication could do with some work."
0,"Rented here for a couple years. Hostile managers, unnecessary confrontations. Rented month-to-month before departure, and they never made the exit process clear, though I told them my planned departure time six and four months in advance. Slapped me with an extra months rent ($900), claiming I'd missed some evacuation notice deadline. I didn't pay, and they've been pursuing me for a $4000 claim since!"
2,"This Macayo's is just like every other Macayo's except they have the slowest service in the world.\n\nStandard chain Mexican food. I normally get the California burrito and an Iced tea. Nothing overly spectacular. Actually, the chips and salsa are really good.\n\nDo not come here if you are in a rush because you will be anxiously shifting in your seat waiting for your check at the end of your meal."
2,Macayo's is a not-very-authentic Mexican restaurant that is great for my family who likes not-very-authentic Mexican food.  I like going here when I visit Phoenix because they have a beef taco with shredded beef instead of ground beef which is found too frequently at other restaurants.  Also one time they accidentally deep fried my whole bean burro which turned out awesome and now I order it that way every time.\n\nI was surprised how bad their house margarita was...I always see people returning with their Macayo's margarita mugs to party the night away.  I had a stomache after finishing that off.\n\nMany years ago we'd visit for Sunday brunch which had a breakfast buffet with a huge selection of breakfast Mexican food.
1,"NEVER AGAIN!! Our group of thirteen; two five, one seven, one 11, well behaved! Two star food, 2  1/2  star service. Food $160.71 tax $13.33 = $174.04 AND $29.00 (18%) tip, yikes! = $203.00. If the food and service is 4, 5, star, 18% is cheap. The worst thing, this dump was my idea, every one else wanted to go to Olive Garden. Never got a bad meal there. If you don't see anyone coming through the door, it'll be me."
2,"Perfect Combination!\n\nMargaritas, salty chips, and fresh salsa . . . what could be better than that?  Add in 1/2 price appetizers for happy hour and you might have an answer.  The Beef Taquitos were the perfect combination of crispy and soft and the baja pizza was pretty good too!"
1,"Ugh, what a waste.  I know that this place is beloved by many, but really and truly this is straight up, flavorless Mexican chain food with some hatch chilies arbitrarily thrown in at times.  It's a total study in mediocrity, from the bland salsa to the weak margaritas.  Tacos, enchiladas, burritos all left me snoozing.  They get a star for their commemorative mugs (hilarious!) and another for their exceptionally wonderful servers (very sweet and attentive) but that's where it ends.  I can't believe this was the place that the President ate at when he came to visit - I'm joining the throngs of people in the valley that swear against this place.  Like Tim Meadows in Dewey Cox \""You don't want no part of this!\"""
2,Wasn't busy but had to wait a little. Food was a little cold on my fiance and son's plate but was discounted. My food came out awesome.
4,"I've had an excellent experience at one Macayo's (Central Av, Phx) & an awful one at another (Ash Av, Tempe), so I didn't really know what to expect here, today.  Here's how it went:\n\nStarting off, they brought me plenty of chips.  They were warm & tasty, & the salsa mild but good.  (When the salsa ran low, my server offered me some more.)\n\nThe \""Mex & Match\"" area of the weekday menu allows you to select one or two of many main item choices, all the same price each, & one or two of a good number of side dish selections, all the same price each.  It's easy to get a meal of exactly what you want from this menu!\n\nI ordered a Chile Relleno & a Shredded Beef Taco for my main items, & Steamed Vegetables & Albondigas Soup for my sides this time.  For the vegetables, they serve you a bunch of different, buttery bite-sized veggie pieces, cooked just right.  The soup was delicious, too.  The Pablano Chile Relleno was a little mild for my taste, but it was BIG, & very well prepared, with plenty of Oaxaca cheese inside.  The shredded beef taco was large too, with plenty of meat, & delicious.  Another thing was that the attractive presentation on the platter & the hot platter itself were both really nice, like something out of an ad where they took all day to prep & photo it!\n\nThis location looks new, & it's VERY nice inside!  It was cold outside, & I landed a comfortable booth near the fire in the fireplace!  My service, from Alex, was friendly & attentive, too.\n\nThis \""Mex & Match\"" Lunch Special is available Monday through Friday 11-4.  I went with the most expensive combination, 2 main items & 2 sides, & it was $8.49.\n\nA LOT of attention to detail has gone into the layout & decor of this restaurant, as well as to the menu, the  preparation of the food, & the presentation of it.  I think there's enough \""specialness\"" here for this Macayo's to deserve 5 Stars!     :-))"
1,"OK but would not choose it over other great restaurants in the area. Portions are good, but the food did not taste fresh the taquitos, were dripping from lard just not appealing."
1,"So, I came to visit a friend in Arizona and after a weekend of hearing about this place, we came here for our farewell lunch. Poor decision. \n\nPerhaps I am just spoiled by Mexican food in my area (and the fact that I am half Mexican and often cook Mexican food at home), but the food was awful. \n\nBetween my husband and myself, we ordered an Enchilada sampler and a Bean & Cheese Burrito - simple right? Apparently getting the food right is not a priority at this place. The green sauce on one of the enchiladas was more of a cream sauce with cheese - seriously disgusting. The bean and cheese burrito obviously used canned beans instead of anything fresh and the tortilla was crispy (not on an awesomely good way either). \n\nOur server was attentive and the Margarita's were decent (the original is refreshing and good with a meal, the strawberry I could have passed on), which are the only reasons that this place is bumped from a One Star to a Two Star review.\n\nIf you are in search of awesome Mexican food, this is NOT it. If you want a super sub par meal with mediocre drinks, head on it.\n\nI will likely not be back, ever...unless it is at my friend's request - even then, it's a maybe."
0,"HMMMM......still no option for zero stars??? well I wish i could give a better review, but it's hard to when you NEVER get greeted!!! LOL So i'll try.....this was the first time i've ever gotten up and walked out of a restaurant. My wife wanted to stay and complain, but we were both pretty hungry already and didnt really want to wait around to talk to some 'Joe Shmoe' Manager, who obviously doesn't give a crap about service and hospitality.\n\nWe walked in at about 8:15-8:20pm lastnight, no hostess, nobody there to greet us. Stood there for about 4-5min, finally a girl walks by and asks, \""oh do you need a table?\""\n\nSo at this point, a little annoyed, but oh well they must have cut the hostess early that night? Start looking at the menu, a couple minutes go by, still no server. We see a couple different servers walk by our table and glance at us but just ignored us. So i guess those servers were all cut? or it wasnt their turn? \n\nWe both knew that they didnt have the full staff of servers on still, but you'd think somebody would eventually greet us.\n\nSo we finish looking at the menu, sat there for another couple minutes. Saw another 2 different servers walk by us and talk to the two booths on both sides of us to ask how things were, and both walked away without talking to us.\n\nI could understand maybe miscommunication, or if we had beverage napkins down already, or if we had walked over from the bar and already had drinks, maybe everyone who walked by us just assumed we had already been helped....\nbut NO!! nothing! we had nothing infront of us, other than 2 folded up menus that we both had read over almost 4 times!! LOL\n\nThen there was one busser that walked by and kind of glanced at us after we had been there for 5 mintues and he could tell something was up. But still nothing.\n\nThen i turned to my wife and said, \""ok lets just go, this is garbage.\"" we were both kind of hesitant about walking about, because we had never done it, but this was a joke! she asked are you sure? should we say something? i said, \""to who? nobody is stopping at our table to greet us, just get up, follow me, lets go.\""\n\nSo as we were sliding out of the booth, we left the menus on the table, nobody tried to stop us or ask us what was wrong, obviously nobody cared. Headed to the exit, right past the host stand. Noticed there were 3 girl servers just hanging out kind of off to the side of the host stand, but still in front for everyone to see. Just chatting with themselves, all of them messing with their phones, one girl had her purse on so she must have been leaving soon. All 3 girls were oblivious and watched us walk out.\n\nNow i've been going to Macayo's since i was 12, back when there was only one location over in mesa, then the one in downtown tempe, and been coming to this location since it opened back when i was in high school. Now the tempe location is great, still go there, the patio is cool, never had a problem there. \n\nBut here, this garbage ahwatukee location, yea its gotten to that point now, garbage. It started off good when it first opened about 10 years ago. But over the years this location has reeeeaaallly dropped off. Not so much the food, dont get me wrong the food has still been consistantly good, but the service over the years! BLEH!!! just like the 17 different times they've re-painted the outside of the restaurant!!!  LOL\n I know management and staffs change over the years, but you can really tell that they dont care anymore.\n\nSo anyone in the ahwatukee area if you're in the mood for mexican food dont even consider Macayo's on 48th & Warner. You'd be better off going to the Taco Bell right there for better service. Or just down 48th street to chandler for Arriba's(which is where we ended uo going)."
3,"The food here was great! I had received a recommendation for Macayo's from my hotel....everything was exactly as he raved about. The place is spacious and bright....the chips and salsa were plentiful and extremely addicting....the service was exceptional. I chose their recommendation (Macayo Chimichanga) which was excellent and I would definitely go back! If you love mexican food, this is a great pick!"
3,Delicous Mexican food at a great price! Love the green chili tamales and chicken chimichangas! Endless chips and salsa are delicious as well.
0,"Stay far far away from here unless you like food that comes out of a can into the microwave and onto your plate. I couldn't eat my meal at all, I had a chicken chimichanga that came out soggy there was so much water left in the chicken. I tried to eat the chicken but it was nasty and fatty. The rice and beans where hot on the outside and cold in the middle. Even the booth we where set at was dirty and had holes in the vinyl.  I will never go back."
0,"If you like AUTHENTIC Mexican food, don't bother.  If you don't know the difference you'll probably be ok.  My feeling is that it is totally \""sanitized\"" with little to no soul.  It's overpriced as well."
1,"I don't know what has happened to this formerly tasty and satisfying restaurant, but things definitely seem to have fallen way below par in terms of taste, quality, and price. I ordered the cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and beans combination plate and was very disappointed to see that the beans were microwaved while the rest of the food lacked flavor. The staff is usually always nice at this location, but the food just isn't worth it anymore. Maybe it's different at different locations, but the only tasty food still left here are the chips and salsa."
0,"Update: Management called to appologize for all th RATS running around and said he'd send me a coupon for our next visit. It never came. Surprised? Not really.\n    \nRATS!!! The wife and I stopped for quatro de Mayo and were halfway through our Quesadilla when I looked to my left and a BIG rat was sitting under the table next to us. As soon as i made a gesture towards him he ran back into the outdoor stainless bar/storage or whatever it is. OK, she was freaked out but I said, \""hey, we're on the patio so &%#$ happens and told the waitress when she came back who was also a bit freaked out especially when I told her how big it was. This was no freakin' mouse. A few minutes later our food came out and as we were engaged in the act of eating... here came another big freaking rat who ran right under our table and out hole in the wall. I once again told the server who was a bit freaked out and started looking around as she went back to wherever she came from. Never did any management staff come out to apologize or maybe offer to move us or something so we finished most of our meal and hit the road. I've been frequenting Macayo's for years but this and the fact that the food quality isn't consistent has ensured we won't frequent this establishment any time soon. We also planm to let everyone we know about this. I've lived here all my life so that's quite a few people"
0,"I will just hit the highlights: \n\nOrdered the carne asada chimichanga with rice & beans. All of my food was room temperature when it came out. As a side note, I've never seen carne asada meat cut so big. They were each sized like pieces you'd cut off a steak. \n\nAfter forcing down half of the chimi I sent the entire plate back to the kitchen. Ultimately it was removed from our bill. \n\nThe waitress brought one of their regular heavy-bottomed glasses to the table for my 6-year old. She also filled my drink so full that it dribbled all over the table as she was handing it across to me instead of walking to my side and setting it down. \n\nThe sopapillas were flat, thick, and very bubbly like fry bread, not light and thin with one big pocket on the inside."
0,"RATS!!! See the manager's 'appology' , Hell,he didn't even visit our table on our less than acceptable experience and he never followed up on his promise via e-mail to take care of us with a discount next time we come in. We still haven't received anything even though I gave him our address. Apparently they could care less although they feel a need to do the requisite \""lip service\"" giving the illusion they are concerned. I've been coming here since they opened the Ahwatukee location and it was a favorite haunt for drinks after hitting 18 at Ahwatukee CC. No more for me, my family and anyone else I remember to tell about our experience"
1,"I like the location and the bar area and the little patio, it's relaxing.  Service was very good.\n\nNow for the food yikes:\n\nChips and salsa, chips are good and light and thin.  Salsa is watery and has no flavor, the hotter salsa was a bit thicker and tasted better.\n\nOrdered like someone else mentioned, the carna asada chimi.  It was huge but I also got the thick chunks of meat inside, I've never seen carne asada look like that.  The worst part is the chimi was very salty.  The rice had no flavor either, so overall it was horrible, and it was expensive.\n\nI'm hard pressed to order any food again, possibly just drinks and hang out."
4,I went to the mesa location a few months ago but don't remember ever coming to this location. We had an in-service day at work so we had an extra long lunch. So me and some coworkers decided to head over here. Great choice. I can't speak for the rest of the menu but their chimis are great. I got the shredded beef one this time. So good. I love them. There is a reason it is their specialty. If you go to a steak house you don't order the chicken or go to a sushi place and order a hamburger. So if it the specialty why get anything else.\nMy girlfriend loves Macayo's too so we will definitely be back. So will my coworkers if we have another long lunch.
1,"Tried it yesterday, because Los Dos Molinos was closed and I wanted to try a new Mexican place.  The service was good.  The margarita was decent.  I tried the carnitas.  Bland.  The beans were terrible.  The food was subpar."
0,"Stopped in for dinner tonight and was greeted promptly And seated very quickly. My waiter was awesome, took our order, got the drinks out and brought us the chips and salsa. The chips were fresh but what in the hell happened to the salsa?!?  \n\nThe salsa looked and tasted like it was 90% tomato paste, 5% chopped veggies, 5% liquid.  The salsa was absolutely gross and tasteless. I inquired about the flavor and texture and he mentioned they recently changed the recipe. He asked if we'd like to try the spicier salsa, said it might be better. \n\nThe spicier salsa was brought out and it wasn't much better. Instead of tomato paste it tasted like a chipotle BBQ sauce. \n\nThe food was super quick coming out which was awesome, however the awesome ended there.  The chicken tortilla soup was more like a salty stew, the trio enchilada plate looked good but the rice was mushy and flavorless, the cheese in top if the Baja sauce was dried out and the pork was chewy and included pieces of fat and tendon. About the best thing in that plate was the black beans \n\nThe carnitas chimmy was so so, the meat was flavorless like it was boiled. \n\nThe chicken in the chicken cilantro lime Caesar salad tasted like it was boiled then lightly grilled.  The lettuce and dressing were pretty good though. \n\nThe tamale bites tasted like deep fried Mac and cheese bite with green chili in them. \n\nWe have our waiter out feedback and again he mentioned the kitchen changed the menu and recipes. We asked for the manager and Maria came out and we gave her the same feedback. She too said there were some changes to the menu and recipes. She apologized for the quality and taste if the food and comp'd half if the meals. \n\nI understand adding new things to the menu to stay current but why change recipes?  \n\nThe 1 star given was only because of the great service and attitude of our waiter and manager.  Can't say I'll be back again, at least not until they fix the recipes and go back to using quality ingredients and improve in their food qualities."
2,"My family and I love Macayos, we eat at the Tempe location all to time. We came her for a quick lunch and ended up staying much longer than anticipated. The food was delicious like usual, the fried ice cream is great! But the service was terrible. We waited forever to get our food, even though there were only a few people there. We will not be eating at this location again."
1,"I would love this place if it wasn't for the food. I like how it is painted on the outside and inside it is all bright colors with different colored chairs. And I think the cheesy d\u00e9cor is pretty cool, too. I love the giant margarita glasses and Mexican Talavera pottery style birds everywhere. The service is passable. But I just can't eat here. Not that this location is particularly bad food or anything. I just really don't like Macayos. Way too much cheese all over everything. Their chips are like cardboard and the salsa never tastes fresh. The tortillas are not authentic Mexican at all. The one thing I do appreciate is that they give you the option of having calabacitas (saut\u00e9ed diced zucchini and corn kernels) as a side dish.  I wish other Mexican places would have a veggie side as an option in addition to the usual rice and beans (they do offer black beans, too which is also nice)."
1,"I have been eating at valley Macayo's for most of my 48 years.  The service is great here and some things still remain, but this location is not living entirely up to the standard as far as food, quality, taste, service size and value for the price.  Old man Woody would not be pleased about this, I'm sure.  \n\nFor starters, the chips.  C  In a way I am glad they are no longer using lard, for health reasons, but they are kind of boring now.  \n\nAnd the salsa.  B-   Where are the flavorful oregano chunks?  What happened with the original recipe?   Mostly tomato sauce.  Boring.  \n\nthe rice. C minus-  It used to be the most flavorful and large portion covering a good chunk of your plate. Where once lovely, soft pieces of oregano and cut green onions lay is now a bland and skimpy small portion.  The original flavor is gone.  PLEASE put it back.  \n\nThe beans.  A+ They are flavorful but portion size is down.  \n\nThe enchilada sauce. A+   It is still the original flavor.  They need to hold on to this.  You have not had great red enchilada sauce until you've had this one.  \n\nThe steak fajitas.  D  - At $15.99 they came in flavorless, kind of chewy and only a miniscule side of beans and pico mixed with lettuce (?) No rice.    It's almost like they forgot to season it.  Sad and not worth the money.   \n\nThe stuffed Pobalano Chile.  C minus.   Another disappointment.  Stuffed with tender chicken and breaded and deep fried, the intention was good.  But temperature of the deep fryer was too hot for this one as the crust was almost over done but the chile had not been properly tenderized.  It needs to be worked on folks.  I think an egg batter a la chile relleno would be an improvement here.  \n\nAnd what happened to the open buffet happy hour?  This used to be my regular drop off point after work.  \n\nThe music.  It was an ecclectic mix of modern Latin.  I didn't really get into it.  \n\nThe decor.  It is still okay.  I think I liked it better previously though.  \n\nThere are still some wonderful econo choices for dishes, but overall, prices seem to have crept up, taste is down and portion size is down.  The old Macayo's was much better.  Please put it back like it was!"
1,"We eat out 3x per week and I can't remember the last time we weren't satisfied with our meals. The house margaritas tasted like just sweet and sour mix so we got dos exis drafts next.  The fish in my fish tacos was grilled so much it was as dry as jerky. The rice was super dry as well. We had eaten here once before and it was fine. Our server, Ryan, was a nice kid and a good server. I guess Macayos is a crap shoot. Good luck."
1,"I'm probably being generous with two stars. Service was so slow! Our server would take our order and would not be seen until he came back several minutes later to deliver said item. I am definitely a Mexican food snob and this sadly doesn't meet my standards. I did live in Pilsen in Chicago, so don't take it personal Mr. Macayo. I wish I could articulate better what I mean but the food was just generic and pretty bland. Kinda mushy...stuff. I will say the stuffed pepper looked amazing. Salsa seemed to be jar salsa but I wasn't in the kitchen so who am I to say :)"
4,My waiter was awesome and my food was.delicious i.got.chicken fajita tacos. Mmmm love it
0,Waited 15 minutes while 2 servers at bar. Was never acknowledged and decided not worth the wait at 3 in the afternoon. Manager was kind however the customer service was at it poorest. Headed to On The Boarder!
0,"Decent dry cleaner, service I done on premises, which is nice, but prices aren't posted anywhere; when I went to pick up my clothes and they told me the total, I thought I heard them wrong. I won't be back."
0,My clothes smelled like armpits & onions when I picked them up. I will never go back.
0,Check all your items before you pay. I have gotten many items back with wrinkles ironed into them. \nThe only reason I take my shirts here is to have them pressed as I HATE ironing. \nIf I have to double check the work of a professional service then they are not worth my time.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Find another cleaner!!!
4,"I eat here so much I'm actually embaressed! This place is amazing, I never liked any form of asian food before I ate here, I always order the same thing..sesame chicken with white rice and crab puffs. I like how tiny the restaurant is and the fact that it is family owned. The owners are so sweet, there is never a wait either. They have really good lunch specials and the food is always fresh."
2,"To start, I'll let the facts speak for themselves. \n\n$1.99 bottles of Heineken \n$1.49 bottles of Bud Light \n\nALL DAY, EVERY DAY! Craziness! \nPanda may not have a happy hour, but with prices like that it seems like it would be happy all the time! \n\nAs if that wasn't enough reason to get you there, the food is pretty good. At first I thought maybe they just got all their customers drunk so the food didn't matter . . . luckily, this is not the case. Panda does not use MSG and has brown rice as an option. Include the fact this place is within walking distance from my house and I am even convincing myself more and more that I need to go there more often, not just all of you. \n\nThe few times I have been, there have only been a few other people in the restaurant so the wait staff is ready and waiting to fulfill your every request. The few times we sat at the bar, the bartender has been very friendly, yet knew when to give us our space as well. Seeing as how there are a total of six seats at the bar, that is a good skill to have. The restaurant is a little small and there isn't much to say about the (lack of) atmosphere. All of that is the reason I am a little leery to give four stars, but right now they are at 3.5 ish. \n\nAdvertisement boasts \""We serve Dim Sum! Made to Order.\"" I haven't tried it, but now that I know it is an option, I'll have to add that to the to-do list for my next visit."
2,Went for dinner with a friend.  Vegetable Deluxe was good but not great.  Service was good until we finished our dinner.  When we continued to talk for about an hour we stopped getting drink refills and were ignored.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if I was hungry and in the area I wouldn't avoid it.
3,"I go here often for lunch and I am never dissappointed. The service is super fast and very friendly. The food is fresh and delicious. I really love the double pleasure, it is shrimp and scallops in a spicy/sweet sauce. \nOnly one thing keeps this place from 5 stars, I would much rather have a cup of soup than the salad. The salad is rather bland and not very good.\nThe prices are great and have daily specials."
4,"I have been eating here for years and have never had a bad meal... Super friendly staff and you can tell its family owned everyone is always happy to see you come in to dine. I always order the same thing the Gang Pang Chicken (Szechwan hot! Battered chicken with spicy hot peppers and green peppers) Lunch combo comes with an egg roll, fried rice and a crab puff... I really enjoy this meal each time I have it and trust me I have had it a lot I highly recommend it."
4,Fast....scrumptious...and great price!! I ordered from here by just picking by name lol...glad I did....from phone convo to delivery it was fast and easy....very poliet staff...i will be ordering again!!
